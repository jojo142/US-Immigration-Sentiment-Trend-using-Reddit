Well the Israeli Government isn't, they want to deport them. Largely this is just another aspect that can be expected of Netanyahu's Likud government which has to make routine concessions like this to the Far right in order to keep his coalition and power.

The Israeli people on the other hand I would say are much more in favor of keeping the refugees in Israel. Israelis are well known for travelling around the world to help work in refugee camps, peace corps, NGOs and rebuilding efforts, etc. However, there government is largely held hostage by an aging and disconnected far right populace.

Here is a great article on Trump's family and their racist history: [PBS - Trump's racist history](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/every-moment-donald-trumps-long-complicated-history-race)

There are literally 50-60+ incidents starting as far back as 1973.  Scarily enough most are recent too, though I wager there are many many more from decades ago they successfully buried we may never hear about...

Here are a few examples:

1973: Discrimination charge. Donald and Fred Trump are accused of violating the Fair Housing Act by discriminating against potential minority renters. They insist they are innocent and fight the sweeping charges.

1989: Central Park Five Ads. After five young men of color — known as The Central Park Five — are arrested for a brutal attack on a jogger, Donald Trump buys full-page newspaper ads  stressing law and order and urging return of the the death penalty. He writes that white, black, Hispanic and Asian families have lost a sense of security in their neighborhoods. (The five men, who Trump called “crazed misfits,” were exonerated 13 years later.)

1992: Trump hotel penalized for discrimination. A judge rules against the Trump Plaza Hotel in New Jersey, concluding the hotel discriminated in removing a African-American dealer from a table at the request of a wealthy player.

1993: “They don’t look like Indians to me,” Trump says during a Congressional hearing when talking about Native American casino officials, accusing them of working with organized crime. He adds that political correctness have given Native American status to some people who don’t “look like Indians.”

Oct. 6, 2000: Secretly funds anti-Native American ads. Trump agrees to apologize and pay a fine for secretly financing sharp ads opposing a Native American gambling proposal. The ads included pictures of syringes and cocaine and asked “Are these the new neighbors we want?”

May 9, 2011: “I am the least racist person there is,” Trump says to FOX News, pointing to the fact that an African-American won “The Apprentice.”

You could write a short novel of all the racist crap Trump has pulled... And once again that just includes what the public is aware of, I can't imagine the kind of stuff he would say/do behind closed doors. Truly sickening, and people try and defend him claiming he ""isn't racist"", he probably makes other racists feel better about themselves...",160,1515721000.0,-0.9917,negative,"Trump attacks protections for immigrants from ‘shithole’ countries in Oval Office meeting I want to say I remember reading an article about how Trump's family, possibly his dad, had stirred racial tensions in the past.

> The federal court for the Eastern District of New York issued an emergency stay halting President Donald Trump&#039;s executive order banning entry to the US from seven majority-Muslim countries tonight, following widespread protests at airports around the country.

> The court ruled on a habeas corpus petition filed by the ACLU on behalf of Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Sameer Abdulkhaleq Alshawi, who were denied entry to the US upon landing at JFK airport in New York City and detained indefinitely by Customs and Border Patrol.

> The ban was issued late on Friday, leading to widespread confusion about how it would be implemented and enforced, chaos as those decisions were made quickly and without a great deal of transparency, and controversy as the essential legality of a ban that effectively targets Muslims was called into question.
