## Overview
This project explores how **public sentiment toward immigration** has evolved on **Reddit** since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. We analyze discussions across multiple subreddits to understand how major political and social events â€” such as the **2022 U.S. congressional elections** â€” have shaped online discourse surrounding **border security**, **asylum policy**, and **national identity**.  

While Reddit is often perceived as a **left-leaning digital space**, our research investigates whether broader national trends toward conservatism have influenced sentiment on the platform. By examining shifts in tone, topics, and engagement patterns, we aim to uncover how Reddit communities reflect â€” or resist â€” changing cultural attitudes about immigration in the United States.

## Research Motivation
Cultural attitudes toward immigration have long been a source of polarization. The rise of social media has amplified this divide, creating new spaces for empathy and hostility alike. Unlike other platforms such as X (formerly Twitter) or Facebook, Redditâ€™s **threaded discussions and community-driven moderation** provide a unique environment for contextual, longitudinal sentiment analysis.

Our study contributes to understanding how **external shocks** â€” including pandemics, elections, and protests â€” influence **online empathy, hostility, and ideological drift**.

## Methodology (Planned)
1. **Data Collection:** Scrape Reddit comments and posts from selected subreddits related to immigration and politics.  
2. **Preprocessing:** Clean text data (tokenization, lemmatization, stopword removal).  
3. **Sentiment Analysis:** Use transformer-based NLP models (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa) to classify sentiment polarity.  
4. **Topic Modeling:** Apply LDA or BERTopic to uncover thematic clusters.  
5. **Trend Analysis:** Visualize sentiment evolution across time and major events.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Python** (pandas, NumPy, nltk, transformers, BERTopic)
- **Reddit API (PRAW)** for data extraction  
- **Hugging Face Models** for sentiment analysis  
- **Tableau / Power BI** for data visualization  
- **Google Colab / Jupyter Notebooks** for experimentation

## Expected Outcomes
- Quantitative and qualitative insights into **how Reddit sentiment toward immigration has shifted** in recent years.  
- Visualization of **temporal sentiment trends** surrounding key events.
