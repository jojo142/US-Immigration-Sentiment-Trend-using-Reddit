By March 31 they will be deemed as illegal immigrants.,"I really don‚Äôt know what all the whining is about and the use of the word ‚Äòdeemed, let‚Äôs face it THEY WILL BE ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS.

To begin with let‚Äôs put things in in perspective, and before people ask - I am a British ex-pat who has lived in Spain for 3 years.

We were informed time and time again over the past 18 months by the British Consulate, the UK Government, the Spanish Government, even the Citizens Advice Bureau in Spain that Brits who wanted to stay should get their paperwork up to date and gain  official residency before 31 Dec 2020. Some lazy fellow brits just stuck their heads in the sand and left things to the last minute or not at all. All I can say is tough luck. Spain are not throwing Brits out they are deporting ‚ÄòIllegal‚Äô immigrants in the same way Britain will deport illegal Spanish immigrants after BREXIT. Do some Brits feel they have a god given right to stay wherever they want?

I have found Spain to be an amazingly welcoming country with friendly people. But to be clear, I am a guest with permanent residency in their country and act as such, in the same way the British expect legal guest immigrants to respect Britain, its laws and customs. 

Former ex-pats that meet the residency requirements can reapply anytime, unless they remain in the country illegally. Rejected applications must have been rejected as they did not meet the residency requirements. It‚Äôs that simple, like in the UK after BREXIT. What‚Äôs good for the goose is also good for the gander.",13748,1616879943.0,0.8893,positive

Half of the country I live in voted to make our lives worse while somehow believing it would make our lives better, but I've yet to hear any concrete arguments for actual benefits of leaving. I don't see fewer immigrants as a good thing because talented and hardworking people coming in taking our jobs means, surprise, there have been employed, talented, hard-working people in the country.

We already had special benefits. Because of the position we were in when the EU formed we had a little litany of unique benefits, like getting to keep our currency.

Then all the people who voted to gut the place in which they live seem to still be acting under the impression the EU owes us anything. We're not an empire anymore. Hadn't been a useful one since the world war. They also seem to act under the assumption that we have some right to be catered to, combined with this bizarre motion that the leaving decision wasn't a two-way street.

The English are by far the most problematic. They party all the time (which is understandable), get shitfaced drunk and drugged and they go wild. They piss in the streets, vandalize public property, trash their accomodation and fight inbetween themselves. No respect to the locals living there, for them it's a party country. This is why I wouldn't recommend going to Hvar for vacation if you want peace and serenity. The only positive thing is you can rip them off as they're used to much higher prices.

Germans, nice loyal guests, some have been coming here for decades. Usually families, will complain about the noise from other apartments to their hosts.

Russians that come here are all loaded, they come on yachts, their private accomodation is some mansion. You don't really see them in the streets and beaches, they're on their own.

Dutch also like to party and get drugged but don't cause as many incidents. They always ask where to get drugs but even if you can help them out and offer market price it feels like you're ripping them off because their stuff is of much better quality. They always split their bills amongst each other, there's no calling for rounds.

Bonus:

Italians and French always complain about everything. Even if you're experienced with them and try to expect what they'll complain about you'll still hear some completely new complaints you've never got, let alone expected. Italians also drive like assholes.

The Czech drive like shit. It seems that it isn't out of malice but that they actually aren't capable of driving properly. They spend little money. Mountain rescue is involved with them a lot as they venture on some mountain wearing flipflops with little or no water at all and they start at noon, in the sweltering heat.

Spanish economy is based a loooooooooooot on tourism and services. To all of us it was always evident that the Brexit was a bad deal (for us), because a lot of our tourism and most of the retired people that choose to retire here come from the UK.

If the UK economy tanks, the UK tourism tanks, and our economy tanks. If the UK residents in Spain are deported, the local restaurants, markets, etc in expat heavy zones go bankrupt, which leads to a rise on unemployment rate, the local economy being ruined, etc etc.

This is even worse when you factor that tourism here usually works by balancing foreign tourist seasons with local tourist seasons as they do not coincide (usually). Expats being kicked back and making UK tourism harder fucks up the foreign season's economy, while at the same time COVID has practically killed local tourism in Spain, because most covid waves have overlapped with the local tourist seasons.

So, as a TL;DR: it must be very hard for them to be kicked back as neither the government nor the local populace wants them gone, no matter how annoying Brexit itself has ben/is.

It most usually, although not always, is someone that moves to a new country (not of their origin) because their job sends them there. An expat back in the early 2000s had a lot of privileges such as being paid their own countries wages in their local area (imagine being paid French wages whilst living in Morocco as an example), and having benefits such as schools and housing being paid for by the company. Being an expat is a huge privilege and I agree that they are technically foreigners, the reason they are treated differently is because of the economic aspect they bring (expat most usually come from large international companies). 

This is just to give context to what expat means (although, it isnt an official definition). My source is me being an expat child having lived the biggest part of my life abroad thanks to my dad's job.

Hate is their fuel. Just like old people's medicine is for the robots that are going to take over and kill us all.

*: I just made a comment about 30 minutes ago about Republicans who protest outside abortion clinics. I've read countless interviews with abortion clinic nurses and providers who repeatedly state that many of the same women that protest wind up in their clinic receiving their services, but ALWAYS say something along these lines, ""Well, you see, my situation is special. I wasn't a whore like all the other girls that come here.""  

And then after being treated with kindness and compassion, **the abortion protestor is seen outside the very clinic they received an abortion at less than a week afterwards, yelling hateful things to the people that treated them with kindness.** Just another example of someone who can't fathom life outside of their own little minds until they are thrust into the same situation. Then, instead of it changing their viewpoint and becoming a better person, they think **they're the exception** and go on right back to hating.

I had this English friend that stayed there for probably a little more than half that time, and he would eat the exact same thing for lunch every day. He didn't particularly like this food, in fact one time he found a random bone in it and freaked out (which was completely understandable given that food should by no means have bones in it). He kept getting it though, because he could just point to the food and the guy would dish it up for him without him needing to speak Spanish. The guy would also give him the biggest portion they offered, because my friend couldn't tell him in Spanish that he just wanted a little bit. I offered to teach him basic Spanish to order something else for lunch, or at least order a smaller portion of the moosh going forward. He told me that was too much of a hassle, and that he'd rather just eat oversized portions of mystery moosh every day than learn basic Spanish...

Although to be fair, the worst example of ""I expect everyone around me to just use English"" came from a German who was screaming at this poor cashier so loudly you'd think he was trying to order a drink while standing next to a jet engine.

He was from Mexico, but his family got him US citizenship when he was a child and moved him up here. I think they said he joined the Navy for a time before getting out and joining Border Patrol. He was a distinguished border patrol agent, got several awards and a fair amount of recognition over his 10+ year career. 

He talked about how he didn't always agree with who he was tasked with deporting, but it was the law and how things worked and he left it at that. I was honestly kind of pissed with how he could view someone in such similar circumstances as himself, but because *their* family didn't do their due diligence, they deserved to have everything taken from them in an instant. Him *and* his wife both voted for Trump, despite him being an immigrant. 

And then they talked about how he was called into his supervisors office one day where he was met with a couple other federal agents. He was informed that his US birth certificate was actually a forgery and completely fake, and he had been illegally living and working in the US for a few decades. He was ordered to turn in his badge, his gun, and then told that he would need to fight it in the courts. Y'know, just like all the people *he* had arrested over the years. He had no idea, his parents/grandparents had lied to him since he was a boy. 

Him and his wife were very upset, obviously, and got legal help. During the interview he had mentioned that they had been fighting in the courts for a couple years already, but they had just submitted their final appeal, likely in vain. They couldn't believe that he, a distinguished federal employee and veteran, couldn't be granted any sort of leniency to try and prevent him from being deported, or that Trump had enacted such tough immigration laws and had basically abandoned them when they felt they needed him. 

The whole interview, like I said, pissed me off because I honestly felt the guy was getting what he deserved. He broke the rules, just like he said all those people he had apprehended over the years, and they needed to suffer the consequences. But once the shoe was on his foot, and *he* was the one being deported, all of a sudden it's ""this isn't fair, this isn't right, this isn't just,"" blah blah blah. 

The most astounding part? I'm pretty sure they both said they (the guy and his wife) had or were going to vote for Trump again in 2020, and... Just, I don't get people. The Republican Party and those who follow it are the epitome of ""rules for thee, not for me,"" and this guy was acting like he was unjustly being targeted when he was literally guilty of everything they said he had done.",499,1616886628.0,-0.9421,negative

The original 'leavers' from 1975 were the Labour left who thought that closer trade was a mechanism whereby more mobile capital would squeeze working wages. The pro-business conservatives were the remainers.

Remember that in 1983 the Labour party fought a general election on a manifesto commitment to leave as well

Another feature from 1975 was that the leavers were the younger voters (those aged under 30). The older voters who had war time memories or the period shortly after were the remainers

In a reversal of what we would see 40 odd years later the two biggest leave voting regions in 1975 were Scotland and Northern Ireland (all regions voted to remain, but the leave vote was strongest there)

What happened in between from the late 80's onwards under Jacques Delors originally, is the EC became less trade focused and more socially focused. The same freedoms given to capital were now given to labour. We also saw a much needed harmonisation of standard rules as well to stop member states cheating in trade and procurement decisions.

This is when the conservatives began to fall out of love with the EC, and when the right wing and centre of the Labour party began to align more closely with it

Corbyn didn't come from that wing of the party, and Cameron was a bit of a fool for thinking he'd mobilise the Labour around a remain vote when he knew that he himself would struggle to win the referendum on the strength of his own party which is believed to have split 58/42 in favour of leaving",12,1616884893.0,0.9843,positive

> The federal court for the Eastern District of New York issued an emergency stay halting President Donald Trump&#039;s executive order banning entry to the US from seven majority-Muslim countries tonight, following widespread protests at airports around the country.

> The court ruled on a habeas corpus petition filed by the ACLU on behalf of Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Sameer Abdulkhaleq Alshawi, who were denied entry to the US upon landing at JFK airport in New York City and detained indefinitely by Customs and Border Patrol.

> The ban was issued late on Friday, leading to widespread confusion about how it would be implemented and enforced, chaos as those decisions were made quickly and without a great deal of transparency, and controversy as the essential legality of a ban that effectively targets Muslims was called into question.

212(f) of the 1952 INA certainly is not in any of those exempted sections, and the text I mentioned above was specifically to add a control that prevented this exact behavior.  Otherwise, the amendment would have said ""except as specifically provided in section 212(f),"" which it doesn't.

In case there was any doubt about the latter provision‚Äôs intent, Trump told Christian Broadcast News that it was intended to **give priority to ‚ÄúChristians‚Äù seeking asylum over ‚ÄúMuslims.‚Äù**

Edit: People are having a hard time understanding that these countries are literally > 97%, and in some cases even > 99% Islam.

* Republicans think Obama is stupid for not believing Russia is US enemy number one.  When Russia hacks the US to interfere with our election, all of a sudden they are A-OK.
* Republicans want to invade Iraq because Saddam has ""WMDs"".  Assad uses chemical weapons on his own citizens in Syria and the Republicans refuse to give Obama authority to intervene with the military.
* GWB, Rove et al use a secret RNC server to hide government communications, and then delete 22 million e-mails instead of turning them over.  E-mails relating to the early stages of the Iraq War as well as e-mails about the politically-motivated firing of US attorneys.  But it's fine!  Hillary Clinton has a private e-mail server - LOCK HER UP LOCK HER UP
* Colin Powell uses private e-mail and recommends Hillary does as well. Hillary does so - LOCK HER UP
* Scalia dies with almost a year left in Obama's term.  Republicans refuse to even *meet with* the centrist moderate Obama nominates.
* Mitch McConnell asks that all of Obama's cabinet members go through full FBI background checks and ethics reviews before they are voted on, delaying Obama's appointments for weeks and months.  Great idea!  Democrats want Trump's cabinet of billionaire's with no government experience to be vetted - ""Democrats are being obstructionist""
* Obama and Congressional Dems propose infrastructure spending during the depths of the Great Recession.  ""Nope can't afford it!""  Trump et al want infrastructure spending when the nation is near full employment?  ""Great idea!""
* Bush reaches the debt ceiling 17 times during his eight years? No big deal, Republicans raise the debt ceiling every single time.  Obama reaches the debt ceiling? Let's shut down the government and lecture everyone about government spending
* Bush starts two wars, passes a massive tax cut, and passes Medicare Part D, with no offsetting tax increases or spending decreases?  Business as usual.  Democrats propose any bill at all?  Republicans now refuse to support it unless there are equal spending cuts
* Obama is president?  The debt and deficit are all that matter.  Trump is president? GOP proposes a budget that will raise the debt by $10T over ten years.  
* Hillary gives speeches to Goldman? She's in the pocket of bankers!  Trump puts five GS people at the upper echelons of his administration?  They're just the best people!
* The Clinton Foundation, a charity, receives money from Saudi Arabia? She's in the pocket of the Saudis!  Trump refuses to put Saudi Arabia (or any Middle East nation he has business in) in his immigration ban, despite a long history of Saudi terrorism?  Nevermind!
* Hillary Clinton runs a charitable foundation that pays her no salary while Secretary of State?  Unfit to be president.  Donald Trump runs a for-profit business while president?  He's a businessman!
* Every presidential candidate releases their tax returns for transparency?  Good practice - Obama better show his college records and birth certificate too.  Trump refuses to show his tax returns?  ""Will of the people, the people don't care, blah blah blah""
* The Bush White House fires eight US attorneys for political reasons?  Just sweep it under the rug.  The IRS allegedly is politically-motivated in its investigation of conservative groups?  Burn it all down, huge conspiracy.
* Online trolls make up a conspiracy about pizza and sex rings and Democrats?  Seems legit.  A well-known, respected ex-MI6 agent comes out with intel detailing possible collusion between Russia and Trump?  Sounds bullshit
* Duplicate e-mails of Hillary Clinton's are found on a laptop days before an election?  Comey better break protocol and talk about a potential investigation before he even has a goddamn warrant.  Trump's campaign staff are being actively investigated for their ties to Russia, as in the FBI is asking for FISA warrants?  ""I can't mention anything, it would tarnish the electoral process""
* Kerry flip flops on the Iraq War, which the Bush administration actively lied about to get approval?  He's terrible!  Pence, Ryan et al flip flop on everything Trump is doing?  Not a whisper.

immigrant,Trumps Immigration Ban Halted By Federal Court,"> Yeah do not vote for the incumbents

This might sound like good advice, but think it through. The most powerful members of congress are in districts that are ""safe"" - if they are doing things you don't like, by all means, vote them out. But in districts where the incumbent is doing the right thing, you want a person with political experience to challenge the more powerful people who are not. Congress is not easy to navigate and it is very hard for a new member to get into a position where they can make much difference. Simply throwing out old people and putting in new ones can actually have the opposite effect you are going for by solidifying the power of people who stay in.

The second part of your advice is good, and I agree with it. I'd add as well that it is very important to vote in primaries - lack of participation in primaries is one of the contributing factors to the increased polarization in our country, because to win, politicians need to appeal to more and more extreme factions in their respective parties.

This coupled with the fact that automation is already in movement, the US is going to have plenty to of manufacturing jobs reshored..yet unavailable to the human labor force.

In a way I'm slightly surprised at some of his orders, since a President does not make decisions without support (which means he has backing on this, so we should also question his backers), no President is completely unchained from answering to his peers and if they become so, well they got taken out in the past, nowadays they just impeach, I'm sure Trump would not last long if he did too many things against the party mandate, which means he has the go ahead on this most likely.

Then when many farmers (example) found people to work these jobs...they later found the Americans to be lazy, unreliable, disrespectful, and ended up having to fire them or they wouldn't show up, and quit. The policy ended up fucking them big time. I think they reversed the decision now. But it was a big deal down there.

Which is annoying since the LNP want to fun PRIVATE schools instead of public schools because fuck education i guess?

Why are we all overlooking the fact that:

* The only thing worse about Anning then the rest of PHON is his lack of a filter.
* The QLD people voted for 2 PHON senators and the people got the first 2 eligible candidates on the PHON ticket. Anning was validly, duly and fairly elected.

This should worry you - not the distraction of mundane mechanics of the intricate edge of senate ballots.

These comments no longer surprise anyone anymore. From his tweets of fake anti-muslim videos^[[1]](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/29/us/politics/trump-anti-muslim-videos-jayda-fransen.html?referer=&referer=) to his actions in gutting programs meant to stop right-wing terrorism, he will inevitably create more racial tension that will lead to racially motivated violence. In 2009 and 2015 the Department of Homeland Security, as well as the FBI, warned us about the rise of right wing terrorism.^[[2]](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/dhs-report-warns-of-right-wing-extremists/) Guess what President Trump and this administration did? They cut funding to protect American citizens from domestic terrorism and instead re-purposed the program to focus on Islamic terrorism leaving American citizens in danger of being killed by other forms of domestic terrorism.^[[3]](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-extremists-program-exclusiv-idUSKBN15G5VO) This action was taken when we know that there is a growing trend of anti-government terrorism.^[[4]](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/16/opinion/the-other-terror-threat.html)


When you had white nationalist and supremacy sympathizers in this administration such as Gorka^[[5]](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/03/sebastian-gorka-white-house-vetting-fail/519843/) and Bannon,^[[6]](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/aug/14/donald-trump-steve-bannon-breitbart-news-alt-right-charlottesville) while continuing to have the likes of  Stephen Miller^[[7]](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2017/aug/15/are-there-white-nationalists-white-house/) in the White House it only further emboldens the White Supremacists and racists. Let us not forget that he has pardoned one of the most racist, disgusting law enforcement Sheriff's around - Joe Arpaio.^[[8]](http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/07/31/540629884/ex-sheriff-joe-arpaio-convicted-of-criminal-contempt)


This is why so many of us are disgusted by the actions of President. Did you watch his unhinged press conference after the Charlottesville tragedy? I have never seen any head of state of a Western ally act in such a belligerent manner, he went so far as to defend Neo-Nazis at the Charlottesville Neo-Nazi rally. You can watch the entire press conference on PBS.^[[9]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbOr0WlA4SI) How about his Arizona speech where he went on a tirade against the fake media, read out his previous words from the press conference while leaving out the most important and controversial bit - fine people on many sides, on many sides. He is defending Neo-Nazis. This was a Neo-Nazi rally. There were no ""fine"" people on both sides. They were making Nazi salutes, flying Nazi flags, wearing Nazi clothes, making Nazi chants. Here is a documentary by VICE News of the Neo-Nazi rally that took place, the one President Trump vehemently defended by stating that there were fine people on this side too.^[[10]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P54sP0Nlngg)


I can't see how his words and actions can be defended. He is acting in a sympathetic manner towards white supremacists and Neo-Nazis. He conflates the idea of Washington and Jefferson owning slaves with a secessionist general who fought to preserve the right to keep slavery legal. There is no equivalence.^[[11]](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-nation-can-only-weep/2017/08/15/d9bd9a10-8202-11e7-902a-2a9f2d808496_story.html?tid=sm_tw&utm_medium=twitter&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_term=.534bcdfb0dd5)





So what raised our suspicions as to why we believe Trump is racist? His public insistence that President Obama wasn't born in America is a racist conspiracy.^[[12]](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/17/us/politics/donald-trump-obama-birther.html) Moreover, how can we excuse the fact that he wanted 5 innocent African American boys to be executed for a heinous crime they did not commit? A settlement was reached recently between the 5 men and the city of New York, yet Trump was still attacking the 5 men.^[[13]](https://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/donald-trump-and-the-central-park-five) We cannot forget his constant attacks against people of colour on Twitter, from his comments about the slain soldier^[[14]](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/23/us/politics/soldiers-widow-says-trump-struggled-to-remember-sgt-la-david-johnsons-name.html) to his never-ending attacks against black athletes.^[[15]](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/22/us/politics/trump-ucla-father-fool.html) All his actions lead to one conclusion, that President Trump is racist. 


There is another unfortunate benefit for a foreign adversary - this administration's racism further pushes and benefits the Kremlin's foreign policy^[[16]](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2017/10/russia-facebook-race/542796/) - to destabilize the west by sowing division among the population.^[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics)

Here is a great article on Trump's family and their racist history: [PBS - Trump's racist history](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/every-moment-donald-trumps-long-complicated-history-race)

There are literally 50-60+ incidents starting as far back as 1973.  Scarily enough most are recent too, though I wager there are many many more from decades ago they successfully buried we may never hear about...

Here are a few examples:

1973: Discrimination charge. Donald and Fred Trump are accused of violating the Fair Housing Act by discriminating against potential minority renters. They insist they are innocent and fight the sweeping charges.

1989: Central Park Five Ads. After five young men of color ‚Äî known as The Central Park Five ‚Äî are arrested for a brutal attack on a jogger, Donald Trump buys full-page newspaper ads  stressing law and order and urging return of the the death penalty. He writes that white, black, Hispanic and Asian families have lost a sense of security in their neighborhoods. (The five men, who Trump called ‚Äúcrazed misfits,‚Äù were exonerated 13 years later.)

1992: Trump hotel penalized for discrimination. A judge rules against the Trump Plaza Hotel in New Jersey, concluding the hotel discriminated in removing a African-American dealer from a table at the request of a wealthy player.

1993: ‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt look like Indians to me,‚Äù Trump says during a Congressional hearing when talking about Native American casino officials, accusing them of working with organized crime. He adds that political correctness have given Native American status to some people who don‚Äôt ‚Äúlook like Indians.‚Äù

Oct. 6, 2000: Secretly funds anti-Native American ads. Trump agrees to apologize and pay a fine for secretly financing sharp ads opposing a Native American gambling proposal. The ads included pictures of syringes and cocaine and asked ‚ÄúAre these the new neighbors we want?‚Äù

May 9, 2011: ‚ÄúI am the least racist person there is,‚Äù Trump says to FOX News, pointing to the fact that an African-American won ‚ÄúThe Apprentice.‚Äù

You could write a short novel of all the racist crap Trump has pulled... And once again that just includes what the public is aware of, I can't imagine the kind of stuff he would say/do behind closed doors. Truly sickening, and people try and defend him claiming he ""isn't racist"", he probably makes other racists feel better about themselves...",162,1515721000.0,-0.9917,negative

It is not to be regarded as anything absolute, what I will relate, just my anecdotal experience and nothing more.


The people that still stand by him are also racist, and are more than thrilled to have an openly racist president represent them.

Let me explain, though, about one of my family members.

One of my family members once said out loud to me when I was much, much younger and impressionable that we should (the US military) bomb the entirety of Iraq during the war because no one would even care and it would ""end the problem early."" 


She once went on a tirade while I was in the car, this time I was a bit older, about how black Americans should be thanking white people for everything we've done for them. She wasn't being superfluous, she believes this. She thinks they owe us thanks because we ""made up for it."" So, yeah.

Skip another couple years, Im visiting her again, show her a picture of my then-girlfriend, a girl from Costa Rica. She didn't ask her name first, she didn't ask me what she likes to do and why we like each other. Her first fucking question was, ""is she legal?""


These are handful of examples of a woman that will just as soon shout that she isn't racist, she's just being *honest.*


These are the people that still like him, that still think hes the right person to figurehead our great nation.


They are fucking racists, too.


Thank you for reading.


PS: She's also the kind of person that starts a sentence with the phrase, ""look, I have more than one gay friend BUT-""

A priest was on a fishing trip hooks a big one. Helping him reel it in, a sailor says, ""Whoa, look at the size of that fucker!""

""Hey, mind your language!"" says the priest.

Embarrassed, the sailor thinks quickly and blurts out, ""Sorry father, but that's what this fish is called - it's a Fucker fish."" Accepting the explanation, the priest forgives the sailor and takes the fish back to church.

""Look at this huge fucker,"" says the priest, spotting the bishop.

""Language, please! This is God's house,"" replies the bishop.

""No, no - that's what this fish is called,"" says the priest.

""Oh,"" says the bishop, scratching his chin. ""I could clean that fucker and we could have it for dinner"".

So the bishop takes the fish, cleans it, and brings it to the mother superior. ""Could you cook this fucker for dinner tonight?"" he asks her.

""My, what language!"" she exclaims, clearly shocked.

""No, sister that's what the fish is called - a fucker,"" says the bishop.

Satisfied with the explanation, the mother superior says, ""Wonderful, I'll cook that fucker tonight - the Pope is coming for dinner!""

The fish tastes just great and the Pope asks where they got it.

""Well, I caught the fucker!"" says the priest.

""And I cleaned the fucker!"" says the bishop.

""And I cooked the fucker!"" says the mother superior.

The Pope stares at them for a minute with a steely gaze, leans back on his chair, takes off his cap, puts his feet up on the table, pours himself a whiskey and says, ""You know what? You assholes are alright"".

Went to claim her social security upon retirement, and they began the deportation process.

Thankfully my family has/had both the funds and the attorneys to fix things and my aunt was able to stay, but it was a tumultuous time.

>If you don‚Äôt know about Real ID, you‚Äôre not alone. It was mandated in 2005 by Congress after the 9/11 Commission recommended federal standards for identification.

>Real IDs carry the same information as your old driver‚Äôs license, along with a variety of safeguards to make them more difficult to counterfeit. To receive one, however, you must meet a new federal standard proving you are who you say you are and you live where you say you do.

>*Real ID won‚Äôt make us safer, it will only divide us.*

>In July 2017, then-Homeland Security director John Kelly announced a 2020 deadline for compliance. ‚ÄúIt is a critically important 9/11 Commission recommendation that others have been willing to ignore,‚Äù Kelly scolded, ‚Äúbut I will not.‚Äù

This bullshit RealId was forgotten in 2004-5 after the fear of 9/11 died down, people are quick to give away rights in fearful attacks which is the opposite reaction we should have.

Trump admin and John Kelly took advantage of this and brought back the RealId which you will have to have initially to enter federal buildings or travel by air/train in the US, eventually it will be needed to vote, so many people are not going to get them, and voting will be problematic.  In a way it is mostly a voter rights issue but ultimately it will be a ""papers please"" moment.

Side note: [John Kelly is on the board of those border detainment centers that hold refugees and citizens with citizenship problems](https://www.businessinsider.com/john-kelly-new-role-will-profit-from-child-separation-policy-2019-5), I bet 5-10 years down the line people without the RealId could end up there if they can't prove they are American.

Note that our election is in November 2020 and the RealId goes into effect October 2020, if voting places are in federal buildings, some will be out of luck.

Not to mention you need your birth certificate to get your RealId, some older people may not even have it or it looks fake and will be hard to get it.  Trump birth certificate long con starting with the attack on Obama, first they came for Obama, then the Muslims, then the Mexicans, now all Americans, even grandma. Side note how Trump is realDonaldTrump and the RealId act, ""real""ly quite fascist.

People don't know it fully yet, but the world has re-aligned, the geopolitical axis changed, authoritarianism has run amok and will not stop with just defense, it must be offense to stop them. The fascists are back in town boys, time to go Nazi killing again soon.

Prepare for the bullshit to go exponential and quadratic.

The next five years are going to be geopolitical shocks around the world as the authoritarians look to take complete control in the chaos.

Even [Dr. Seuss knew you can't appease authoritarians](https://imgur.com/a/U5iVr30).

Underestimate the new wave of [authoritarianism like this scene from Monty Python and the Holy Grail](https://youtu.be/DPXG4pdPj4w?t=13).

The cheaters are winning, you can't cooperate with cheaters. Authoritarians are on offensive offense, you can't just play defense, you have to play offense to get them on defense.

In game theory, if the other side cheats and your side keeps cooperating, you will lose every time. There is a [great little game theory game that highlights it here called The Evolution of Trust](https://ncase.me/trust/).",2,1581975277.0,-0.9965,negative

I can tell you that, regardless of brexit, they are an utterly, woefully incompetent and devoid of care department.  

Their systems have been outdated for a very long time, only recently moving online and doing so in a clumsy half paperwork half online confusing fashion.  Before this, everything was a massive lump of paperwork you had to fill in and post, we're talking up until a few years ago it was like this. 

The paperwork they use and their terminologies are quite confusing for even an English speaking person to understand having no previous experience. They use what on the surface are vague terms but in fact have a meaning in law and are not flexible.  

You will get no help from them via any of the minimal contact options (there aren't any), any questions will go unanswered officially as they see it as possibly assisting someone to get an immigration status by skirting the rules.

They will take your money, fucking piles of it, and they will never, ever, refund you. By this I mean, if you pay ¬£1500 and make a tiny mistake on the first page, so it takes them only 4 seconds to reject it, say goodbye to your money and pay again for another go.  Regardless of the work actually put in, they will charge the same.  And, no joke, when **they** made a mistake, they still rejected it forcing more costs I'll never recoup.  They are a money black hole. If you're well off you won't care, if you're an average person, rip your finances.

Although they let you fill it all in yourself, and given you manage to do many government forms yourself, you are being lulled into a false sense of security. They say ""oh hey you can get legal advice"", given the already expensive process you try it alone. No, it should be mandatory, because their processes are far more rigid and unsympathetic that you would think.  Everything needs a lawyer and the associated fuck my bank balance costs. 

They take as long as they damn well please, with no updates. When will you hear from them? Go find mystic Meg and ask her, because you won't get anything from them. You could be waiting a week, or 6 months. And that's nothing to do with if you did it all right either, your shit just sits in a dark corner waiting to be looked at for as long as it takes.  There are people that waited so long to hear back, that when they finally did and found out they'd done it wrong, they were now an illegal immigrant and got dragged off to a detention centre.

The staff turnover in their department is tragically high, because who wants to be the one to break up families and send people away, it sucks. People with a soul last 6 months there, the ones left are jaded, hardened bastards who have no empathy left, if they ever had it. 

You have no control, no communication routes, no options, just take that massive wad of paperwork, bend over and take it up the ass, hard, hoping you've done everything right so you don't have to take it again.

It was hell. 

After submitting the application, paying the $3000, and attending a biometric appointment where they specifically **cannot discuss your application**, I was just ghosted. The first I heard back was a strangely uninformative email from *Sheffield* saying that they‚Äôd made a mistake in my visa and I needed to send it, and my passport, back to them so they could fix it. One big problem with that: they hadn‚Äôt sent the visa or given me back my passport. They were asking me to resubmit documents *they* possessed. 

I couldn‚Äôt email them back because the account was ‚Äúnot monitored‚Äù. There was no one to call. I did pay $10 to send an email to UKVI, but they **cannot discuss your application** so that went unanswered. I even opened a ‚Äúlost parcel‚Äù query with AusPost in case it‚Äôd been lost somewhere, and they were far more responsive and caring! With UKVI there is no office you can walk into, no human being you can speak to, there isn‚Äôt even a goddamn web bot! I truly think the only reason I got my documents in the end is because I got the *University of goddamn Cambridge* to email them every single day on my behalf, navigate all the legalese, and annoy them into submission. 

UKVI swore they‚Äôd sent the documents **but** you have to provide your own return envelope and I got one with tracking, so I knew for a fact they hadn‚Äôt mailed them 3 weeks earlier. The documents just mysteriously showed up 2 days before I had to leave the country, no mistakes on the visa, no explanation from UKVI, no apology. I truly believe that there is actually no pipeline in the application process, they just take your documents, dump them in a room with everything else, and pull one piece of paper out each day at random. If hell exists, it‚Äôs the visa application process.

I was incredibly surprised. I have worked in various areas of the civil service and if there is one thing they all have in common it is this: the staff are absolutely useless, incompetent lazy fucks who wouldn't know their elbow from their arsehole. My stepmother was complaining about the cuts to the civil service that happened a few years ago and I just said that in four different departments and four different parts of the country you could cut 50%of the worst staff and you would lose maybe 10% of the productivity. It was disgusting watching tax money being pissed up the wall paying lazy perverts to interview visa applicants 

Don't get me wrong, I don't support the cuts because it'll be broad strokes and we will lose the bad and good staff but I saw so much wasted time that I expected some massive cockup with my application and it would take so long to get back that I'd never live with my wife.

He isn't being accused of migrating illegally. He isn't being deported. The rules have changed and people from the EU no longer have automatic right to live in the UK.

All they need is some sort of easily obtained proof that they have lived there that long.

Bear in mind that this is in response to him applying for a scheme. He has applied for it and been told they want some very reasonable and readily available paperwork. It's not like they're going round getting proof from all EU citizens that they've lived there for a few years.

And it's funny, cause this is the kind of shit at least in Canada is why people go towards predatory lenders like Cash Advance places. There was someone recently doing an investigation on why people go to Payday Loan places to cash in cheques, advance money etc. because these places aside from payment fees cater to the situation of impoverished people (while exploiting it) while actual banks do not. People find it difficult to use actual banks for the above reasons + their general unwillingness to work with low income people or even minorities. 

There was a case recently in British Columbia where an Indigenous grandfather and granddaughter where arrested at a Bank of Montreal (BMO) branch by police. The story was this: granddad wants to open an account for he granddaughter who travels a lot for sport events in order to be able to easily send her money on her trips. He provides his Indian Status Card amongst other things as ID. The Indian Status Card is federally issued and legal ID for all purposes in Canada, bank employee doesn't know what to do with it and phones the police for concerns of fraud. When police arrive they handcuff the grandfather and elementary school aged girl in the bank in front of everyone and lead them away.

Stories like that actively dissuade individuals from communities like that from engaging in the formal economy. Also consider that throughout the 20th c. Canada engaged in a policy of assimilation by taking Indigenous children away from their parents, placing them in Residential Schools that utilized a number of tactics to force them to abandon their culture. Not to mention numerous sexual abuses happened in these schools amongst other abuses.

There's **NO** evidence other than a study I think that was during the 1800s that go against any findings done since.  (The study that Nixon got scared of)

NHS capacity numbers would decline, mental health would decline... And guess what, employment increases. People think those on welfare just enjoy being skint all the time, it's so ludicrous that people even have the capacity to complain about welfare. 

If we want to see change, I promise you our lifetimes are the best times for it. AI is giving us unprecedented chances and universal income is one of them. It's the answer to the UKs current shortfall with particular problems, I promise. 

We need someone to publicly advocate this and strike debates with piers Morgan and shit. That's the only way we can start changing the conversation and nobody dares do it.

overdraft protection. It 'protects' you by moving money from your savings to your checking for a nominal fee. The fee is usually higher than any merchant is allowed to charge for a bounced check or the like, and it allows the bank to collect the fee multiple times.

If you disable overdraft protection, with my current shitty bank, they make one purchase that puts your account into negative dollars, and then your card won't make anymore purchases. If you put money into the account before the end of the day they don't charge you a fee.

Best part, the fee for letting your account close with a negative balance is less than the fee charge EVERY TIME you make a purchase with 'overdraft protection'

To begin with let‚Äôs put things in in perspective, and before people ask - I am a British ex-pat who has lived in Spain for 3 years.

We were informed time and time again over the past 18 months by the British Consulate, the UK Government, the Spanish Government, even the Citizens Advice Bureau in Spain that Brits who wanted to stay should get their paperwork up to date and gain  official residency before 31 Dec 2020. Some lazy fellow brits just stuck their heads in the sand and left things to the last minute or not at all. All I can say is tough luck. Spain are not throwing Brits out they are deporting ‚ÄòIllegal‚Äô immigrants in the same way Britain will deport illegal Spanish immigrants after BREXIT. Do some Brits feel they have a god given right to stay wherever they want?

I have found Spain to be an amazingly welcoming country with friendly people. But to be clear, I am a guest with permanent residency in their country and act as such, in the same way the British expect legal guest immigrants to respect Britain, its laws and customs. 

Former ex-pats that meet the residency requirements can reapply anytime, unless they remain in the country illegally. Rejected applications must have been rejected as they did not meet the residency requirements. It‚Äôs that simple, like in the UK after BREXIT.

Half of the country I live in voted to make our lives worse while somehow believing it would make our lives better, but I've yet to hear any concrete arguments for actual benefits of leaving. I don't see fewer immigrants as a good thing because talented and hardworking people coming in taking our jobs means, surprise, there have been employed, talented, hard-working people in the country.

We already had special benefits. Because of the position we were in when the EU formed we had a little litany of unique benefits, like getting to keep our currency.

Then all the people who voted to gut the place in which they live seem to still be acting under the impression the EU owes us anything. We're not an empire anymore. Hadn't been a useful one since the world war. They also seem to act under the assumption that we have some right to be catered to, combined with this bizarre motion that the leaving decision wasn't a two-way street.

Needing to apply implies the right to reject you.

Right now, there is very little reason for European countries to do any favors for Brits.

They went from having guaranteed rights to be anywhere in Europe at any time to needing to apply for narrow, short-term versions of that right.

The English are by far the most problematic. They party all the time (which is understandable), get shitfaced drunk and drugged and they go wild. They piss in the streets, vandalize public property, trash their accomodation and fight inbetween themselves. No respect to the locals living there, for them it's a party country. This is why I wouldn't recommend going to Hvar for vacation if you want peace and serenity. The only positive thing is you can rip them off as they're used to much higher prices.

Germans, nice loyal guests, some have been coming here for decades. Usually families, will complain about the noise from other apartments to their hosts.

Russians that come here are all loaded, they come on yachts, their private accomodation is some mansion. You don't really see them in the streets and beaches, they're on their own.

Dutch also like to party and get drugged but don't cause as many incidents. They always ask where to get drugs but even if you can help them out and offer market price it feels like you're ripping them off because their stuff is of much better quality. They always split their bills amongst each other, there's no calling for rounds.

Bonus:

Italians and French always complain about everything. Even if you're experienced with them and try to expect what they'll complain about you'll still hear some completely new complaints you've never got, let alone expected. Italians also drive like assholes.

The Czech drive like shit. It seems that it isn't out of malice but that they actually aren't capable of driving properly. They spend little money. Mountain rescue is involved with them a lot as they venture on some mountain wearing flipflops with little or no water at all and they start at noon, in the sweltering heat. We like them because they're probably the most loyal visitors.

Spanish economy is based a loooooooooooot on tourism and services. To all of us it was always evident that the Brexit was a bad deal (for us), because a lot of our tourism and most of the retired people that choose to retire here come from the UK.

If the UK economy tanks, the UK tourism tanks, and our economy tanks. If the UK residents in Spain are deported, the local restaurants, markets, etc in expat heavy zones go bankrupt, which leads to a rise on unemployment rate, the local economy being ruined, etc etc.

This is even worse when you factor that tourism here usually works by balancing foreign tourist seasons with local tourist seasons as they do not coincide (usually). Expats being kicked back and making UK tourism harder fucks up the foreign season's economy, while at the same time COVID has practically killed local tourism in Spain, because most covid waves have overlapped with the local tourist seasons.

So, as a TL;DR: it must be very hard for them to be kicked back as neither the government nor the local populace wants them gone, no matter how annoying Brexit itself has ben/is.

Apparnetly the genetleman deported had lived in the town for 20 + years, raised a family there, OWNED THE ONLY MEXICAN RESTAURANT IN TOWN, was loved by all the people there......

Interview after interview these white folks said they LOVED TRUMP and **still** supported his push to get rid of illegals, but they wanted him to make an exception for *their* illegal. 

Just like every other thing and republicans.....they are filled with hate and anger until their policies affect themselves.....then they have an epiphany, say something akin to ""I didn't think the leopards would eat *my* face"" and then keep on hating the next day.* (* explained at bottom)

Hate is their fuel. Just like old people's medicine is for the robots that are going to take over and kill us all.

*: I just made a comment about 30 minutes ago about Republicans who protest outside abortion clinics. I've read countless interviews with abortion clinic nurses and providers who repeatedly state that many of the same women that protest wind up in their clinic receiving their services, but ALWAYS say something along these lines, ""Well, you see, my situation is special. I wasn't a whore like all the other girls that come here.""  

And then after being treated with kindness and compassion, **the abortion protestor is seen outside the very clinic they received an abortion at less than a week afterwards, yelling hateful things to the people that treated them with kindness.** Just another example of someone who can't fathom life outside of their own little minds until they are thrust into the same situation. Then, instead of it changing their viewpoint and becoming a better person, they think **they're the exception** and go on right back to hating.

I had this English friend that stayed there for probably a little more than half that time, and he would eat the exact same thing for lunch every day. He didn't particularly like this food, in fact one time he found a random bone in it and freaked out (which was completely understandable given that food should by no means have bones in it). He kept getting it though, because he could just point to the food and the guy would dish it up for him without him needing to speak Spanish. The guy would also give him the biggest portion they offered, because my friend couldn't tell him in Spanish that he just wanted a little bit. I offered to teach him basic Spanish to order something else for lunch, or at least order a smaller portion of the moosh going forward. He told me that was too much of a hassle, and that he'd rather just eat oversized portions of mystery moosh every day than learn basic Spanish...

He was from Mexico, but his family got him US citizenship when he was a child and moved him up here. I think they said he joined the Navy for a time before getting out and joining Border Patrol. He was a distinguished border patrol agent, got several awards and a fair amount of recognition over his 10+ year career. 

He talked about how he didn't always agree with who he was tasked with deporting, but it was the law and how things worked and he left it at that. I was honestly kind of pissed with how he could view someone in such similar circumstances as himself, but because *their* family didn't do their due diligence, they deserved to have everything taken from them in an instant. Him *and* his wife both voted for Trump, despite him being an immigrant. 

And then they talked about how he was called into his supervisors office one day where he was met with a couple other federal agents. He was informed that his US birth certificate was actually a forgery and completely fake, and he had been illegally living and working in the US for a few decades. He was ordered to turn in his badge, his gun, and then told that he would need to fight it in the courts. Y'know, just like all the people *he* had arrested over the years. He had no idea, his parents/grandparents had lied to him since he was a boy. 

Him and his wife were very upset, obviously, and got legal help. During the interview he had mentioned that they had been fighting in the courts for a couple years already, but they had just submitted their final appeal, likely in vain. They couldn't believe that he, a distinguished federal employee and veteran, couldn't be granted any sort of leniency to try and prevent him from being deported, or that Trump had enacted such tough immigration laws and had basically abandoned them when they felt they needed him. 

The whole interview, like I said, pissed me off because I honestly felt the guy was getting what he deserved. He broke the rules, just like he said all those people he had apprehended over the years, and they needed to suffer the consequences. But once the shoe was on his foot, and *he* was the one being deported, all of a sudden it's ""this isn't fair, this isn't right, this isn't just,"" blah blah blah. 

The most astounding part? I'm pretty sure they both said they (the guy and his wife) had or were going to vote for Trump again in 2020, and... Just, I don't get people. The Republican Party and those who follow it are the epitome of ""rules for thee, not for me,"" and this guy was acting like he was unjustly being targeted when he was literally guilty of everything they said he had done.",502,1616886628.0,-0.9421,negative

By March 31 they will be deemed as illegal immigrants.,"Socialists have always been sceptical of Europe (I mean left wing socialists, not the left of centre social democrats). 

The original 'leavers' from 1975 were the Labour left who thought that closer trade was a mechanism whereby more mobile capital would squeeze working wages. The pro-business conservatives were the remainers.

Remember that in 1983 the Labour party fought a general election on a manifesto commitment to leave as well

Another feature from 1975 was that the leavers were the younger voters (those aged under 30). The older voters who had war time memories or the period shortly after were the remainers

In a reversal of what we would see 40 odd years later the two biggest leave voting regions in 1975 were Scotland and Northern Ireland (all regions voted to remain, but the leave vote was strongest there)

What happened in between from the late 80's onwards under Jacques Delors originally, is the EC became less trade focused and more socially focused. The same freedoms given to capital were now given to labour. We also saw a much needed harmonisation of standard rules as well to stop member states cheating in trade and procurement decisions.

This is when the conservatives began to fall out of love with the EC, and when the right wing and centre of the Labour party began to align more closely with it

Corbyn didn't come from that wing of the party, and Cameron was a bit of a fool for thinking he'd mobilise the Labour around a remain vote when he knew that he himself would struggle to win the referendum on the strength of his own party which is believed to have split 58/42 in favour of leaving",11,1616884893.0,0.9843,positive

> The federal court for the Eastern District of New York issued an emergency stay halting President Donald Trump&#039;s executive order banning entry to the US from seven majority-Muslim countries tonight, following widespread protests at airports around the country.

> The court ruled on a habeas corpus petition filed by the ACLU on behalf of Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Sameer Abdulkhaleq Alshawi, who were denied entry to the US upon landing at JFK airport in New York City and detained indefinitely by Customs and Border Patrol.

> The ban was issued late on Friday, leading to widespread confusion about how it would be implemented and enforced, chaos as those decisions were made quickly and without a great deal of transparency, and controversy as the essential legality of a ban that effectively targets Muslims was called into question.

Edit:  For the people upvoting the guy citing 212(f) of the INA. The INA was amended in 1965 and specifically states: ""No person shall [...] be discriminated against in the issuance of an immigrant visa [see above] except as specifically provided in section 101(a)27, section 201(b), and section 203""

212(f) of the 1952 INA certainly is not in any of those exempted sections, and the text I mentioned above was specifically to add a control that prevented this exact behavior.  Otherwise, the amendment would have said ""except as specifically provided in section 212(f),"" which it doesn't.

* Republicans think Obama is stupid for not believing Russia is US enemy number one.  When Russia hacks the US to interfere with our election, all of a sudden they are A-OK.
* Republicans want to invade Iraq because Saddam has ""WMDs"".  Assad uses chemical weapons on his own citizens in Syria and the Republicans refuse to give Obama authority to intervene with the military.
* GWB, Rove et al use a secret RNC server to hide government communications, and then delete 22 million e-mails instead of turning them over.  E-mails relating to the early stages of the Iraq War as well as e-mails about the politically-motivated firing of US attorneys.  But it's fine!  Hillary Clinton has a private e-mail server - LOCK HER UP LOCK HER UP
* Colin Powell uses private e-mail and recommends Hillary does as well. Hillary does so - LOCK HER UP
* Scalia dies with almost a year left in Obama's term.  Republicans refuse to even *meet with* the centrist moderate Obama nominates.
* Mitch McConnell asks that all of Obama's cabinet members go through full FBI background checks and ethics reviews before they are voted on, delaying Obama's appointments for weeks and months.  Great idea!  Democrats want Trump's cabinet of billionaire's with no government experience to be vetted - ""Democrats are being obstructionist""
* Obama and Congressional Dems propose infrastructure spending during the depths of the Great Recession.  ""Nope can't afford it!""  Trump et al want infrastructure spending when the nation is near full employment?  ""Great idea!""
* Bush reaches the debt ceiling 17 times during his eight years? No big deal, Republicans raise the debt ceiling every single time.  Obama reaches the debt ceiling? Let's shut down the government and lecture everyone about government spending
* Bush starts two wars, passes a massive tax cut, and passes Medicare Part D, with no offsetting tax increases or spending decreases?  Business as usual.  Democrats propose any bill at all?  Republicans now refuse to support it unless there are equal spending cuts
* Obama is president?  The debt and deficit are all that matter.  Trump is president? GOP proposes a budget that will raise the debt by $10T over ten years.  
* Hillary gives speeches to Goldman? She's in the pocket of bankers!  Trump puts five GS people at the upper echelons of his administration?  They're just the best people!
* The Clinton Foundation, a charity, receives money from Saudi Arabia? She's in the pocket of the Saudis!  Trump refuses to put Saudi Arabia (or any Middle East nation he has business in) in his immigration ban, despite a long history of Saudi terrorism?  Nevermind!
* Hillary Clinton runs a charitable foundation that pays her no salary while Secretary of State?  Unfit to be president.  Donald Trump runs a for-profit business while president?  He's a businessman!
* Every presidential candidate releases their tax returns for transparency?  Good practice - Obama better show his college records and birth certificate too.  Trump refuses to show his tax returns?  ""Will of the people, the people don't care, blah blah blah""
* The Bush White House fires eight US attorneys for political reasons?  Just sweep it under the rug.  The IRS allegedly is politically-motivated in its investigation of conservative groups?  Burn it all down, huge conspiracy.
* Online trolls make up a conspiracy about pizza and sex rings and Democrats?  Seems legit.  A well-known, respected ex-MI6 agent comes out with intel detailing possible collusion between Russia and Trump?  Sounds bullshit
* Duplicate e-mails of Hillary Clinton's are found on a laptop days before an election?  Comey better break protocol and talk about a potential investigation before he even has a goddamn warrant.  Trump's campaign staff are being actively investigated for their ties to Russia, as in the FBI is asking for FISA warrants?  ""I can't mention anything, it would tarnish the electoral process""

immigration,Trumps Immigration Ban Halted By Federal Court,"> Yeah do not vote for the incumbents

This might sound like good advice, but think it through. The most powerful members of congress are in districts that are ""safe"" - if they are doing things you don't like, by all means, vote them out. But in districts where the incumbent is doing the right thing, you want a person with political experience to challenge the more powerful people who are not. Congress is not easy to navigate and it is very hard for a new member to get into a position where they can make much difference. Simply throwing out old people and putting in new ones can actually have the opposite effect you are going for by solidifying the power of people who stay in.

The second part of your advice is good, and I agree with it. I'd add as well that it is very important to vote in primaries - lack of participation in primaries is one of the contributing factors to the increased polarization in our country, because to win, politicians need to appeal to more and more extreme factions in their respective parties.

My town is known for Throwing a backpacker off a bridge because he was foreign.........also for talking about how muslims should die and let me not forget mass amounts of kids running around at night in groups of 50+ smashing cars or attacking bystanders.

Also the LNP who won kept using scare tactics on a population that is argueably less educated than the other states.

Which is annoying since the LNP want to fun PRIVATE schools instead of public schools because fuck education i guess?

These comments no longer surprise anyone anymore. From his tweets of fake anti-muslim videos^[[1]](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/29/us/politics/trump-anti-muslim-videos-jayda-fransen.html?referer=&referer=) to his actions in gutting programs meant to stop right-wing terrorism, he will inevitably create more racial tension that will lead to racially motivated violence. In 2009 and 2015 the Department of Homeland Security, as well as the FBI, warned us about the rise of right wing terrorism.^[[2]](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/dhs-report-warns-of-right-wing-extremists/) Guess what President Trump and this administration did? They cut funding to protect American citizens from domestic terrorism and instead re-purposed the program to focus on Islamic terrorism leaving American citizens in danger of being killed by other forms of domestic terrorism.^[[3]](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-extremists-program-exclusiv-idUSKBN15G5VO) This action was taken when we know that there is a growing trend of anti-government terrorism.^[[4]](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/16/opinion/the-other-terror-threat.html)


When you had white nationalist and supremacy sympathizers in this administration such as Gorka^[[5]](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/03/sebastian-gorka-white-house-vetting-fail/519843/) and Bannon,^[[6]](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/aug/14/donald-trump-steve-bannon-breitbart-news-alt-right-charlottesville) while continuing to have the likes of  Stephen Miller^[[7]](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2017/aug/15/are-there-white-nationalists-white-house/) in the White House it only further emboldens the White Supremacists and racists. Let us not forget that he has pardoned one of the most racist, disgusting law enforcement Sheriff's around - Joe Arpaio.^[[8]](http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/07/31/540629884/ex-sheriff-joe-arpaio-convicted-of-criminal-contempt)


This is why so many of us are disgusted by the actions of President. Did you watch his unhinged press conference after the Charlottesville tragedy? I have never seen any head of state of a Western ally act in such a belligerent manner, he went so far as to defend Neo-Nazis at the Charlottesville Neo-Nazi rally. You can watch the entire press conference on PBS.^[[9]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbOr0WlA4SI) How about his Arizona speech where he went on a tirade against the fake media, read out his previous words from the press conference while leaving out the most important and controversial bit - fine people on many sides, on many sides. He is defending Neo-Nazis. This was a Neo-Nazi rally. There were no ""fine"" people on both sides. They were making Nazi salutes, flying Nazi flags, wearing Nazi clothes, making Nazi chants. Here is a documentary by VICE News of the Neo-Nazi rally that took place, the one President Trump vehemently defended by stating that there were fine people on this side too.^[[10]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P54sP0Nlngg)


I can't see how his words and actions can be defended. He is acting in a sympathetic manner towards white supremacists and Neo-Nazis. He conflates the idea of Washington and Jefferson owning slaves with a secessionist general who fought to preserve the right to keep slavery legal. There is no equivalence.^[[11]](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-nation-can-only-weep/2017/08/15/d9bd9a10-8202-11e7-902a-2a9f2d808496_story.html?tid=sm_tw&utm_medium=twitter&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_term=.534bcdfb0dd5)





So what raised our suspicions as to why we believe Trump is racist? His public insistence that President Obama wasn't born in America is a racist conspiracy.^[[12]](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/17/us/politics/donald-trump-obama-birther.html) Moreover, how can we excuse the fact that he wanted 5 innocent African American boys to be executed for a heinous crime they did not commit? A settlement was reached recently between the 5 men and the city of New York, yet Trump was still attacking the 5 men.^[[13]](https://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/donald-trump-and-the-central-park-five) We cannot forget his constant attacks against people of colour on Twitter, from his comments about the slain soldier^[[14]](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/23/us/politics/soldiers-widow-says-trump-struggled-to-remember-sgt-la-david-johnsons-name.html) to his never-ending attacks against black athletes.^[[15]](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/22/us/politics/trump-ucla-father-fool.html) All his actions lead to one conclusion, that President Trump is racist. 


There is another unfortunate benefit for a foreign adversary - this administration's racism further pushes and benefits the Kremlin's foreign policy^[[16]](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2017/10/russia-facebook-race/542796/) - to destabilize the west by sowing division among the population.^[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics)

immigration,Trump attacks protections for immigrants from ‚Äòshithole‚Äô countries in Oval Office meeting,"I want to say I remember reading an article about how Trump's family, possibly his dad, had stirred racial tensions in the past. I forget what the endgame was but they apparently spread propaganda to create racial tension which I assume they then abused for personal gain.

Here is a great article on Trump's family and their racist history: [PBS - Trump's racist history](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/every-moment-donald-trumps-long-complicated-history-race)

There are literally 50-60+ incidents starting as far back as 1973.  Scarily enough most are recent too, though I wager there are many many more from decades ago they successfully buried we may never hear about...

Here are a few examples:

1973: Discrimination charge. Donald and Fred Trump are accused of violating the Fair Housing Act by discriminating against potential minority renters. They insist they are innocent and fight the sweeping charges.

1989: Central Park Five Ads. After five young men of color ‚Äî known as The Central Park Five ‚Äî are arrested for a brutal attack on a jogger, Donald Trump buys full-page newspaper ads  stressing law and order and urging return of the the death penalty. He writes that white, black, Hispanic and Asian families have lost a sense of security in their neighborhoods. (The five men, who Trump called ‚Äúcrazed misfits,‚Äù were exonerated 13 years later.)

1992: Trump hotel penalized for discrimination. A judge rules against the Trump Plaza Hotel in New Jersey, concluding the hotel discriminated in removing a African-American dealer from a table at the request of a wealthy player.

1993: ‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt look like Indians to me,‚Äù Trump says during a Congressional hearing when talking about Native American casino officials, accusing them of working with organized crime. He adds that political correctness have given Native American status to some people who don‚Äôt ‚Äúlook like Indians.‚Äù

Oct. 6, 2000: Secretly funds anti-Native American ads. Trump agrees to apologize and pay a fine for secretly financing sharp ads opposing a Native American gambling proposal. The ads included pictures of syringes and cocaine and asked ‚ÄúAre these the new neighbors we want?‚Äù

May 9, 2011: ‚ÄúI am the least racist person there is,‚Äù Trump says to FOX News, pointing to the fact that an African-American won ‚ÄúThe Apprentice.‚Äù

You could write a short novel of all the racist crap Trump has pulled... And once again that just includes what the public is aware of, I can't imagine the kind of stuff he would say/do behind closed doors. Truly sickening, and people try and defend him claiming he ""isn't racist"", he probably makes other racists feel better about themselves...",160,1515721000.0,-0.9917,negative

immigration,Trump attacks protections for immigrants from ‚Äòshithole‚Äô countries in Oval Office meeting,"I'll go ahead and make a wild conjecture that I do hold as true based upon anecdotal experience with some of his supporters, these supporters being family. It is not to be regarded as anything absolute, what I will relate, just my anecdotal experience and nothing more.


The people that still stand by him are also racist, and are more than thrilled to have an openly racist president represent them.

Let me explain, though, about one of my family members.

One of my family members once said out loud to me when I was much, much younger and impressionable that we should (the US military) bomb the entirety of Iraq during the war because no one would even care and it would ""end the problem early."" 


She once went on a tirade while I was in the car, this time I was a bit older, about how black Americans should be thanking white people for everything we've done for them. She wasn't being superfluous, she believes this. She thinks they owe us thanks because we ""made up for it."" So, yeah.

Skip another couple years, Im visiting her again, show her a picture of my then-girlfriend, a girl from Costa Rica. She didn't ask her name first, she didn't ask me what she likes to do and why we like each other. Her first fucking question was, ""is she legal?""


These are handful of examples of a woman that will just as soon shout that she isn't racist, she's just being *honest.*


These are the people that still like him, that still think hes the right person to figurehead our great nation.


They are fucking racists, too.


Thank you for reading.


PS: She's also the kind of person that starts a sentence with the phrase, ""look, I have more than one gay friend BUT-""

You get the picture.

immigration,Trump attacks protections for immigrants from ‚Äòshithole‚Äô countries in Oval Office meeting,"I think I saw this on a documentary about the pope:

A priest was on a fishing trip hooks a big one. Helping him reel it in, a sailor says, ""Whoa, look at the size of that fucker!""

""Hey, mind your language!"" says the priest.

Embarrassed, the sailor thinks quickly and blurts out, ""Sorry father, but that's what this fish is called - it's a Fucker fish."" Accepting the explanation, the priest forgives the sailor and takes the fish back to church.

""Look at this huge fucker,"" says the priest, spotting the bishop.

""Language, please! This is God's house,"" replies the bishop.

""No, no - that's what this fish is called,"" says the priest.

""Oh,"" says the bishop, scratching his chin. ""I could clean that fucker and we could have it for dinner"".

So the bishop takes the fish, cleans it, and brings it to the mother superior. ""Could you cook this fucker for dinner tonight?"" he asks her.

""My, what language!"" she exclaims, clearly shocked.

""No, sister that's what the fish is called - a fucker,"" says the bishop.

Satisfied with the explanation, the mother superior says, ""Wonderful, I'll cook that fucker tonight - the Pope is coming for dinner!""

The fish tastes just great and the Pope asks where they got it.

""Well, I caught the fucker!"" says the priest.

""And I cleaned the fucker!"" says the bishop.

""And I cooked the fucker!"" says the mother superior.

The Pope stares at them for a minute with a steely gaze, leans back on his chair, takes off his cap, puts his feet up on the table, pours himself a whiskey and says, ""You know what? You assholes are alright"".

I have met countless Haitian people - I've worked with them, ate with them, spoken with them - from many walks of life. One thing they all have in common? They're the sweetest fucking people in the world. They'll feed you, pray for you, hang out with you and you don't even have to fucking say hi to them. They're just so happy to be in the US. They come here with every intention of integrating without losing a single shred of what also makes them Haitian. I've NEVER spoken to a single Haitian person in Miami that does not speak fluent English. Of course they exist, but they're exceedingly rare. These people are exceedingly hardworking, good-natured to the bone, and genuinely a pleasure to be around.


I'm absolutely certain that our president has never actually given a Haitian person the time of day a single day in his life.

They claimed they sent me a letter, they told me to come to court and I didn't show up. Maybe I didn't came because you sent it in sutton coldfield??? The place where I do NOT live??? So because I didn't show up, the incompetent, inexperienced and unqualified (  [https://www.gov.uk/become-magistrate/can-you-be-a-magistrate](https://www.gov.uk/become-magistrate/can-you-be-a-magistrate)  ) decided that automatically the council wins the case and I must pay taxes. So the council told me ''ok, prove you didn't live there'', ok, I gave them my passport. Nope, ''it's a romanian passport''... see, because despite both uk and romania being in the european union, us romanians are subhuman scum and the english passports are above everyone else. No no no, a passport is not an acceptable form of identification... I needed to show ENGLISH bills... electricity, gas, internet etc. or I could go speak to the landlord in sutton coldfield. Yeah, guilty until proven innocent. I have to go search for a person that I never met before.

The councils in uk are nothing but criminals who try to steal as much money as possible while shamelessly harassing us. This is one example of many.

edit: apparently lots of people never saw a passport before, maybe american ones don't show the address but if you don't know what you're talking about, keep quiet. Google photos of a passport if you never seen one before. Also, the issue wasn't that a passport doesn't show an address. The issue was, as stated a few times to me by the council, ''it's a ROMANIAN passport'', if it was an uk passport they would've accepted it, same as a driver's licence.",66,1581958056.0,-0.9642,negative

This bullshit RealId was forgotten in 2004-5 after the fear of 9/11 died down, people are quick to give away rights in fearful attacks which is the opposite reaction we should have.

Trump admin and John Kelly took advantage of this and brought back the RealId which you will have to have initially to enter federal buildings or travel by air/train in the US, eventually it will be needed to vote, so many people are not going to get them, and voting will be problematic.  In a way it is mostly a voter rights issue but ultimately it will be a ""papers please"" moment.

Side note: [John Kelly is on the board of those border detainment centers that hold refugees and citizens with citizenship problems](https://www.businessinsider.com/john-kelly-new-role-will-profit-from-child-separation-policy-2019-5), I bet 5-10 years down the line people without the RealId could end up there if they can't prove they are American.

Note that our election is in November 2020 and the RealId goes into effect October 2020, if voting places are in federal buildings, some will be out of luck.

Not to mention you need your birth certificate to get your RealId, some older people may not even have it or it looks fake and will be hard to get it.  Trump birth certificate long con starting with the attack on Obama, first they came for Obama, then the Muslims, then the Mexicans, now all Americans, even grandma. Side note how Trump is realDonaldTrump and the RealId act, ""real""ly quite fascist.

People don't know it fully yet, but the world has re-aligned, the geopolitical axis changed, authoritarianism has run amok and will not stop with just defense, it must be offense to stop them. The fascists are back in town boys, time to go Nazi killing again soon.

Prepare for the bullshit to go exponential and quadratic.

I can tell you that, regardless of brexit, they are an utterly, woefully incompetent and devoid of care department.  

Their systems have been outdated for a very long time, only recently moving online and doing so in a clumsy half paperwork half online confusing fashion.  Before this, everything was a massive lump of paperwork you had to fill in and post, we're talking up until a few years ago it was like this. 

The paperwork they use and their terminologies are quite confusing for even an English speaking person to understand having no previous experience. They use what on the surface are vague terms but in fact have a meaning in law and are not flexible.  

You will get no help from them via any of the minimal contact options (there aren't any), any questions will go unanswered officially as they see it as possibly assisting someone to get an immigration status by skirting the rules.

They will take your money, fucking piles of it, and they will never, ever, refund you. By this I mean, if you pay ¬£1500 and make a tiny mistake on the first page, so it takes them only 4 seconds to reject it, say goodbye to your money and pay again for another go.  Regardless of the work actually put in, they will charge the same.  And, no joke, when **they** made a mistake, they still rejected it forcing more costs I'll never recoup.  They are a money black hole. If you're well off you won't care, if you're an average person, rip your finances.

Although they let you fill it all in yourself, and given you manage to do many government forms yourself, you are being lulled into a false sense of security. They say ""oh hey you can get legal advice"", given the already expensive process you try it alone. No, it should be mandatory, because their processes are far more rigid and unsympathetic that you would think.  Everything needs a lawyer and the associated fuck my bank balance costs. 

They take as long as they damn well please, with no updates. When will you hear from them? Go find mystic Meg and ask her, because you won't get anything from them. You could be waiting a week, or 6 months. And that's nothing to do with if you did it all right either, your shit just sits in a dark corner waiting to be looked at for as long as it takes.  There are people that waited so long to hear back, that when they finally did and found out they'd done it wrong, they were now an illegal immigrant and got dragged off to a detention centre.

The staff turnover in their department is tragically high, because who wants to be the one to break up families and send people away, it sucks. People with a soul last 6 months there, the ones left are jaded, hardened bastards who have no empathy left, if they ever had it. 

You have no control, no communication routes, no options, just take that massive wad of paperwork, bend over and take it up the ass, hard, hoping you've done everything right so you don't have to take it again.

As a result, the people who protect the organization push out those who care about the organization.  This is one of those truths that seems to pop up everywhere.

It was hell. 

After submitting the application, paying the $3000, and attending a biometric appointment where they specifically **cannot discuss your application**, I was just ghosted. The first I heard back was a strangely uninformative email from *Sheffield* saying that they‚Äôd made a mistake in my visa and I needed to send it, and my passport, back to them so they could fix it. One big problem with that: they hadn‚Äôt sent the visa or given me back my passport. They were asking me to resubmit documents *they* possessed. 

I couldn‚Äôt email them back because the account was ‚Äúnot monitored‚Äù. There was no one to call. I did pay $10 to send an email to UKVI, but they **cannot discuss your application** so that went unanswered. I even opened a ‚Äúlost parcel‚Äù query with AusPost in case it‚Äôd been lost somewhere, and they were far more responsive and caring! With UKVI there is no office you can walk into, no human being you can speak to, there isn‚Äôt even a goddamn web bot! I truly think the only reason I got my documents in the end is because I got the *University of goddamn Cambridge* to email them every single day on my behalf, navigate all the legalese, and annoy them into submission. 

UKVI swore they‚Äôd sent the documents **but** you have to provide your own return envelope and I got one with tracking, so I knew for a fact they hadn‚Äôt mailed them 3 weeks earlier. The documents just mysteriously showed up 2 days before I had to leave the country, no mistakes on the visa, no explanation from UKVI, no apology. I truly believe that there is actually no pipeline in the application process, they just take your documents, dump them in a room with everything else, and pull one piece of paper out each day at random. If hell exists, it‚Äôs the visa application process.

Don't get me wrong, I don't support the cuts because it'll be broad strokes and we will lose the bad and good staff but I saw so much wasted time that I expected some massive cockup with my application and it would take so long to get back that I'd never live with my wife.

* They may not have a birth certificate, or if they did have one, records may be long lost.  Prior to desegregation in 1965, county birth records were stored separately, and while after that they were all stored together, a lot of the records for black Americans were conveniently ""lost"" during the merging of the archives
* Elderly people, especially those in group homes, may not have proof of residency if the utilities are not in their names
* Elderly people may not have a valid driver's license because they don't drive any more
* Elderly people may not have the means to travel to a place for alternate forms of ID (because they are also usually the driver's services places and are not in city centers) let alone the means to pay for them when they are not free

The issue of missing birth records also impacted white elderly Americans to a much lesser degree, although their records started becoming accurate around 1945 after WWII.

So white elderly people over the age of 75, and black elderly people over the age of 55, are at a real risk of not having the required proof of their own birth that most state's voter ID laws call for.",92,1581960647.0,-0.8658,negative

He isn't being accused of migrating illegally. He isn't being deported. The rules have changed and people from the EU no longer have automatic right to live in the UK. However, it is being granted automatically to people who have lived here for at least five years despite that. All they need is some sort of easily obtained proof that they have lived there that long. In the vast majority of cases they already have it so it's almost totally automatic, however as he had no digital records for whatever reason they had to have him send some over.

Bear in mind that this is in response to him applying for a scheme. He has applied for it and been told they want some very reasonable and readily available paperwork. It's not like they're going round getting proof from all EU citizens that they've lived there for a few years.

I currently live outside of the US. There were a lot of reasons for my move but I wanted to learn a new language, experience more cultures, and see more of the world.

My mother pleaded with me to stay the months leading up to my move. During one of these begging sessions she said the saddest thing I've ever heard her say, ""I just don't understand why anyone would ever leave the US.""

Oh you don't have money at time of automated payments in your account, let's attempt to withdraw, decline, and then charge you for us overdafting your account. 40$ sounds about good. Enjoy your -40$, oh btw you still need to pay that automated bill that was never paid. Thanks! 

I just don't understand how the latter is allowed. But then I guess there wouldn't be a need to sell overdraft protection for a few $ a month!

And it's funny, cause this is the kind of shit at least in Canada is why people go towards predatory lenders like Cash Advance places. There was someone recently doing an investigation on why people go to Payday Loan places to cash in cheques, advance money etc. because these places aside from payment fees cater to the situation of impoverished people (while exploiting it) while actual banks do not. People find it difficult to use actual banks for the above reasons + their general unwillingness to work with low income people or even minorities. 

There was a case recently in British Columbia where an Indigenous grandfather and granddaughter where arrested at a Bank of Montreal (BMO) branch by police. The story was this: granddad wants to open an account for he granddaughter who travels a lot for sport events in order to be able to easily send her money on her trips. He provides his Indian Status Card amongst other things as ID. The Indian Status Card is federally issued and legal ID for all purposes in Canada, bank employee doesn't know what to do with it and phones the police for concerns of fraud. When police arrive they handcuff the grandfather and elementary school aged girl in the bank in front of everyone and lead them away. 

https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/12-year-old-indigenous-girl-recounts-handcuffing-at-bmo-1.5433662

Stories like that actively dissuade individuals from communities like that from engaging in the formal economy. Also consider that throughout the 20th c. Canada engaged in a policy of assimilation by taking Indigenous children away from their parents, placing them in Residential Schools that utilized a number of tactics to force them to abandon their culture. Not to mention numerous sexual abuses happened in these schools amongst other abuses. So it's a community already mistrustful of authority and when they try to engage with mainstream society this is how they get treated?",225,1581961892.0,-0.883,negative

overdraft protection. It 'protects' you by moving money from your savings to your checking for a nominal fee. The fee is usually higher than any merchant is allowed to charge for a bounced check or the like, and it allows the bank to collect the fee multiple times.

If you disable overdraft protection, with my current shitty bank, they make one purchase that puts your account into negative dollars, and then your card won't make anymore purchases. If you put money into the account before the end of the day they don't charge you a fee.

Best part, the fee for letting your account close with a negative balance is less than the fee charge EVERY TIME you make a purchase with 'overdraft protection'

> While death records are not categorised by occupation or place of work, it is likely many workers who have died were employed on these World Cup infrastructure projects, says Nick McGeehan, a director at FairSquare Projects, an advocacy group specialising in labour rights in the Gulf.

> The Qatar government says that the number of deaths - which it does not dispute - is proportionate to the size of the migrant workforce and that the figures include white-collar workers who have died naturally after living in Qatar for many years.

> The committee organising the World Cup in Qatar, when asked about the deaths on stadium projects, said: &quot;We deeply regret all of these tragedies and investigated each incident to ensure lessons were learned. We have always maintained transparency around this issue and dispute inaccurate claims around the number of workers who have died on our projects.""

As far as I can see the number is not put into perspective to the number of migrants, instead simply going on about that the results are not transparent, and cause of death is not determined by autopsy.

A quick calculation says that 6500 deaths, with 2 million workers over 10 years, is approximately 325 per million per year, or 0,032 %.

Is that high or low? 1,2 % is not an uncommon death rate, but these workers are probably young. And not all workers death are included.

> The Israeli government is giving tens of thousands of Eritrean and Sudanese asylum seekers a stark choice: deportation or indefinite imprisonment.

> More than 7,500 Israelis signed a petition, published by &quot;Zazim - Community Action&quot; earlier this month, calling on the Israel Airline Pilots Association and ground services staff at Ben Gurion Airport to &quot;Stand on the right side of history and refuse participate in this immoral deportation.""

> It is unclear whether El Al pilots will be asked to fly asylum seekers out of Israel, but declarations like those published by these three pilots send a message of solidarity to the asylum seekers - and can perhaps influence pilots flying for other airlines that are being asked to carry out Israel&#039;s dirty work.

I'm not sure if it's a given, but I think that in Sudan, as well as a lot of middle eastern countries, there is animosity towards Israel, likely stemming from religious differences(Sudan, as well as other middle eastern countries, is a predominantly Muslim country, even if less so than Saudi Arabia or the others). 

So, I hope this news gets out, so that muslims and arabs, and people that bear animosity towards Israel for any reason, be it cultural or religious, can see that Israelis are also *human*.

Constant war, a brutal and secretive dictatorship, poverty, disease, and a complete lack of human rights.

Many countries have conscription. Eritrea has indefinite, permanent, conscription. Roving gangs will enter a village and take away any male they find. The male is then in the Army until he escapes or dies.

Eritreans cannot travel inside the country, so if there is drought or famine in your area you cannot travel to another part of Eritrea to find work or food. 

If you leave the country without permission you are either jailed without trial, tortured until a bribe is paid, or conscripted for life upon return.

The country operates on a system of bribes. If you cannot pay a bribe you are arbitrarily detained without charge or trial until your family can scrape together enough cash, which is hard because in order to control the population the government limits the amount of money you can have at any one time.

Foreign media is banned, and as part of their ""national service"" hundreds of thousands of Eritreans are forced to work as slave labor in mines, extracting minerals and rare earth metals for suppliers who then turn around and sell those materials to foreign companies that turn them into cellphones and video game consoles.

Women are forced into national service as well, when sent to military camps for their service they are used as sexual slaves.

**Anyone who claims that an Eritrean refugee is an ""economic migrant"" is completely ignorant of the situation in that country.**

Sudan isn't much better.

The UN has never declared that everyone from ANY country is not entitled to refugee status.  That is a determination that can only be made on an individual basis, because it is based on the presence or absence of legitimate threats to the lives, health or safety of the potential refugee.

For example, there is no widespread civil unrest or public violence in the United States that would allow every American to flee the country and claim refugee status.  However, 12 U.S. citizens were granted asylum in Britain in 2015.

The core idea remains the same that Zionism believes in a home for the Jewish people, where they will no longer be persecuted, and to further the ""jewish cause"" by extending compassion to others fighting oppression. (Keep in mind most Jews believe in being Jewish as a culture, not as a religion. So the 'Jewish cause' has more in common with saying American values of liberalism.)

Well the Israeli Government isn't, they want to deport them. Largely this is just another aspect that can be expected of Netanyahu's Likud government which has to make routine concessions like this to the Far right in order to keep his coalition and power.

The Israeli people on the other hand I would say are much more in favor of keeping the refugees in Israel. Israelis are well known for travelling around the world to help work in refugee camps, peace corps, NGOs and rebuilding efforts, etc. However, there government is largely held hostage by an aging and disconnected far right populace.

Can you quote and/or link to the international law that says this? Amnesty tells me (in the context of the EU mind you which, granted, Israel; Ethiopia; Djibouti and Sudan are not in)...

>>There is no legal requirement for a refugee to claim asylum in any particular country

>>Neither the 1951 Refugee Convention nor EU law requires a refugee to claim asylum in one country rather than another.

>>There is no rule requiring refugees to claim in the first safe country in which they arrive.

>>The EU does run a system ‚Äì called the Dublin Regulations ‚Äì which allows one EU country to require another to accept responsibility for an asylum claim where certain conditions apply.

>>The relevant conditions include that the person is shown to have previously entered that other EU country or made a claim there. This is supposed to share responsibility for asylum claims more equitably among EU countries and discourage people moving on from one EU country to another. But it doesn‚Äôt work.

>>It is clear the system greatly benefits countries like the UK and is very unfair to countries like Greece and Italy. That‚Äôs part of the reason Germany has just suspended the Dublin Regulations when dealing with people fleeing from Syria.

edit: Yea, it's just not true. 

>>There is no obligation under the refugee convention or any other instrument of international law that requires refugees to seek asylum in any particular country. There has, however, been a longstanding ""first country of asylum"" principle in international law by which countries are expected to take refugees fleeing from persecution in a neighbouring state. This principle has developed so that, in practice, an asylum seeker who had the opportunity to claim asylum in another country is liable to be returned there in order for his or her claim to be determined.  https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/libertycentral/2010/sep/21/claim-asylum-uk-legal-position and http://www.unhcr.org/uk/excom/scip/3ae68ccec/background-note-safe-country-concept-refugee-status.html 

So a refugee is still a refugee even if they have travelled through safe and stable countries. However, over time countries have come to state by state agreements with each other that they can, if they want, pass a refugee back to the safe and stable countries they passed through and, if those countries agree to take them, that has been regarded as legally reasonable and as not contradicting international law. 

It's like that agreement you have with your neighbour that you're both going to paint each side of the fence between you. Legally you can tell him to fuck off because it's his fence not yours but in practice it's worked out well for both of you if you both do it, and it doesn't contradict any laws, so you both carry on doing it.",13,1516656368.0,0.9914,positive

I hope you don't have some image of the people smugglers as salty-bearded rebels, squinting out at the ocean and promising their huddled cargo safe passage to the golden fields of Australia. The people smuggling business is a criminal enterprise, the people who are smuggled are often vulnerable, manipulated and threatened, and by receiving the boats the Australian government participates in their exploitation.

> Oh and it's also about safety.

It is that as well. These old, broken-down boats inevitably capsize in the middle of nowhere and everyone on board dies - and *then* Australia is blamed for not reacting fast enough. So Australia has to receive, from criminals, these people who don't have identification *and* has to ensure they are received safely?

It specifically stated that on Jan. 1, 1863 all slaves in areas still under rebellion would be declared free and could be conscripted into military/government service. Lincoln said in September that he was going to do this to give rebels a chance to surrender. Slaves held in territory not in rebellion (like Maryland) were not freed by the EP. Of course slaves in confederate territory weren't *de facto* freed until the territory was liberated, although many chose to free themselves, as the fugitive slave act could not apply to a runaway slave from a territory that was in revolt.  Slavery was officially abolished by the 13th Amendment, passed after Lincoln's death. 
 
The point is that Lincoln's election moved states to secede because he would 'take their slaves.' Then he gave them a chance to surrender and keep their slaves. Then he freed slaves held by all those still in rebellion. But a slave in Delaware in December 1862 was still a slave in 1863, and would remain so until 1865 unless they got a lucky break. Odds are Lincoln would have just let slavery die out by cracking down on the illegal transatlantic slave trade, repealing the Fugitive Slave Act and barring slavery in any new territories.

The U.S, while currently accepting asylum seekers from Central America when they reach our border, has given Mexico millions of dollars to fortify their southern border, giving Mexico the task of deporting legitimate refugees back to their war torn countries. Europe also did everything in it's power to block Syrian refugees from entering the EU during the Syrian crisis. Spain has given Morocco tons of  money for them to keep African migrants from crossing the border into Spanish enclaves on the Mediterranean. Heck, even Arab states like Saudi Arabia and Yemen worked hard keeping Syrians from flowing south to their countries.

It's in our best interest (Mexico as a whole) for illegal migrants to be vaccinated rather than some of our own people since they are of high mobility. They are increasingly exposed in the US, both due to high density population centers and the nature of the jobs they tend to occupy. And they come back to Mexico sometimes.

There are huge towns in Northern and Southern Mexico that are basically isolated from everybody else, so they aren't exactly at risk. But some illegal migrant in LA coming down to visit, or making friends with legal migrants who'd transmit it to them, who are more likely to then spread it to their families; Those people are of high interest to get vaccinated ASAP. Not even touching on how badly their families need them not to die to keep receiving their income.

America has a LOT of problems, but one thing I really respect is that they (generally) don't negotiate with terrorist/criminal demands. If cartels had say, taken over the city of Houston, America would have marched the entire god damm military into the city and put that shit on lockdown.

There was a lot of promise and excitement, in that he was an outsider from a party that had never won. Promised to support the little guy, and redistribute wealth. Sort of a Mexican Bernie Sanders.

As a non-Mexican I don't have a full sense of what has happened, but needless to say AMLO has disappointed a lot of Leftists. Crime rates are rising and insecurity remains a huge issue for many. And AMLO's Covid denial early on in the pandemic made him come across like Trump, an out of touch idiot to many people.

Still, don't forget that the guy before him left office with only an 18% approval rating, and allegedly stole a bunch of famous artwork from *Los Pinos* (the luxurious residence of the Mexican president) on his way out. So, needless to say, Mexico has a long history of shitty and corrupt Presidents. AMLO, to his credit, refused to live in *Los Pinos* and turned it into a Cultural space open to the public. He does appear to genuinely want to fix wealth inequality and make Mexico a better place.

He just, as I understand it, has not been doing a very good job of it. Of course Mexico has a long history of corruption, and nothing changes overnight. So personally, I credit him for at least trying.

migrant,Mexican president offers to vaccinate unlawful migrants in U.S.,"That's exactly what Felipe Calderon thought. His drug war instead brought a massive increase in killings in the country and Mexico's  murder rate has since never been lower than it was prior to that decision.  You can guess by [looking at this graph](https://www.macrotrends.net/countries/MEX/mexico/murder-homicide-rate) what year he declared open war on the cartels.

The cartels are far too entrenched in Mexican institutions, including the army (noting here the Los Zetas were literally formed by ex-special forces) to solve the problem by throwing away soldiers and civilians in exchange for cartel muscle. Ever hear how journalists, local politicians and activists get murdered all the time in Mexico? That often happens in collaboration or tacit approval of law enforcement. The Mexican state would destroy itself before it destroyed the cartels if it pushed the issue.

When leaders get killed, guess what happens?

This is horrifying and evil, but it's also wildly impractical. Like most of Trump's ideas.


For one, Gitmo is on an island. The only way to get there is by aircraft into their very small airfield, or by boat into their very small port. These facilities were meant to handle the arrival of small groups of military personnel, not process detained migrants by the hundreds.


Additionally Gitmo (the existing detention center and the wider Naval Station) aren't designed for that many people. The existing detention center held less than 700 at it's greatest capacity, and that number has been under 20 for some time. The base isn't currently designed to house the additional personnel you'd need to run a 30,000 person prison either.¬†


So you've got a massive infrastructure project, the supplies for which will have to be funneled through the same airfield/port we mentioned earlier, at least until those too can be expanded. And even if you can build the prison, and staff it, and get all the migrants there you still have to supply the all these new people through the same port and airfield.¬†

There is no strategy to stop the rise of the nazis. They monopolize force. The only possible method is to get ahead of them, and monopolize force before they do. But no one believes they're a real threat until they're literally in a boxcar on their way to the camps. 

I'm still having to fight half the people I know on musks ""unfortunate gesture"" being a clear dogwhistle to the nazis. It's not even that they'reacting in bad faith, they're just genuinely deeply naive, and think that somehow nazis would be completely forthright and honest about who they are, and not act mendaciously. Which, is exactly the opposite of what nazis are. They're even called nazis because they pretended to be socialists. And they acted with such mendacity and cunning, even the socialists within their own ranks believed it. The night of the long knives was the purging of the actual socialists elements within their ranks. Those who believed the lie, even as they participated in it.

Kristallnacht was 5 years later in 1938.

In 1940 the first Jewish concentration camps were opened. Camps had been used by the Nazis previously to hold ‚Äúhabitual criminals‚Äù and political prisoners. Camps for Jews had much worse conditions.

In 1941 the third Reich agreed on The Final Solution. Their killing was limited by logistics, and by the unwillingness of military leaders to spend scarce bullets that were needed in the east.

1942 was peak holocaust. After determining gas was the most efficient method, Germany murdered several million Jews.

1943 Germany began losing the war. Rebellions and riots began breaking out at extermination camps causing progress towards the Final Solution to slow. Civilian uprisings in Poland slowed progress.

In 1944 Germany began marching what prisoners remained to Central Germany, in an attempt to finish the job there and destroy the evidence of their crimes. Soviet forces liberated a camp for the first time.¬†

1945 the world discovered the full scale of the horror show the Germans had produced.

They are Nazis now. I went to a Trump rally in 2016, the parallels were clear to me then. I am the descendant of a pair of young Germans who recognized the Nazis were evil before Kristallnacht and immigrated to the United States.

There isn't any other country that can take any action against the US military. It is that powerful.¬†


Even if, say, China India and the EU on their combined strength decided the US was going too far, they could realistically field like 8 Aircraft carriers against the US's 11. And the Caribbean is a god damned American lake. No one is projecting power there.


What we have seen in the past years, since Desert Storm, Actually probably since Vietnam, through the Great War on Terror and Afghanistan is the US barely lifting its little finger in terms of military mobilisation.¬† If, and let's hope it never happens, the US ever gets serious about war you would see a flexing of military might the likes of which we haven't seen since the 1940s. I'd remind you that during WW2 the US was counting its shipbuilding in hours, not days or weeks, but hours to get Liberty ships in the water. I'd imagine with todays modern warfare of drones and missiles, they'd be measuring production in minutes. The scale of US military hardware is inconceivable to most of us outside of the US.


Like it's big news if a Euro country buys 50 F-35s. The US floats 80 of them on each carrier, and they have 11 of them. That's 880 fighters just with the Navy. Ignoring the Air Force, the Marine Corps and the Army with combined arms doctrine, and you've still got a force that outmatches any other two nations combined. Its also ignoring their Space based abilities like satellites and other stuff that's important to a modern military like drones, economic and electronic warfare, logistics and all that. Not to mention Tanks, IFVs, trucks and Artillery.


And once you've got through all that, assuming by some miracle you have a Genghis Khan or Alexender the Great type of General, they have still got nukes.


On subs, in silos, mounted to planes.¬†


And even if you survived that nuclear holocaust, youve still got over 400 million guns in the hands of 300 million civilians.


It is not a war you are going to win, and most assuredly it is not a war you want to fight. No, no sane country is fielding an army against the US.


So let's say military action is off the the table, could economic sanctions work? Well no, as the US is energy independent and food self sufficient. The US is not like the UK during WW2 where food had to be imported across the Atlantic.

You're already doing an incredible amount. 

There are other things that can be done though. 

Engage with those on the other side. Not by telling them that what you're scared of or how much it looks like history repeating or why things they believe are wrong or bad. 

Flip the script. Don't talk about your views, ask about theirs. Ask them why they believe what they believe. Just keep asking questions. If you see a weakness in their argument, ask them a question that makes them think about that weakness. I managed to change someone's opinion on capital punishment by asking questions and realising why they held that view. I realised they were religious so I asked ""who are we to judge if someone should live or die? Do we know better than God?"" They got very thoughtful after that. 

Even more important, if they say something you agree with, tell them you agree. I once got someone who claimed they were anti feminist to realise that they were actually feminist by telling them that I completely agreed with everything they were saying about people being hired on merit and that that was why I'm femanist.

Telling people you agree with them makes them more open to your views because you seem more reasonable in their eyes. You can tell an anti trans person that you agree that the whole toilet debate is ludicrous and then follow up with ""why not just make unisex bathrooms with cubicles only?"". Since you started by  a show of common ground, there's a better chance they'll actually think about what you said. 

It obviously won't work with everyone, but hopefully it creates a ripple. 


Other more concrete actions:

Why not contact AOC or another leader and ask them to take stronger action?

If they aren't/won't/can't, why not try yourself? Or ask someone charismatic you know to be the face of the movement. Regular people can get the ball rolling and start a bigger movement. 

Or, organise some proper old school protests. Job walk outs or sit-ins in disruptive places. Study what people like Martin Luther King, Gandhi, and other change makers used as tactics and try them. 

Those last options are scary as hell, and require insane amounts of determination and potentially self sacrifice and definitely aren't things to be taken lightly. But they're ideas.

Hearst also diversified his publishing interests into book publishing and magazines. Several of the latter are still in circulation, including such periodicals as Cosmopolitan, Good Housekeeping, Town and Country, and Harper's Bazaar.

In 1924, Hearst opened the New York Daily Mirror, a racy tabloid frankly imitating the New York Daily News. Among his other holdings were two news services, Universal News and International News Service, or INS, the latter of which he founded in 1909.\[34\] He also owned INS companion radio station WINS in New York; King Features Syndicate, which still owns the copyrights of a number of popular comics characters; a film company, Cosmopolitan Productions; extensive New York City real estate; and thousands of acres of land in California and Mexico, along with timber and mining interests inherited from his father""

and he was a Nazi.

This faction is what many people think of when you say Republican, they have been extremely influential within the party since the 50s. They want massive cuts to government spending, lower taxes, and to eliminate regulations. Basically, extremely pro-capitalism and very free-market economics. 

They aren't inherently socially conservative, just fiscally conservative. So they aren't inherently against the idea of pro-abortion, gay marriage and gun control. But they often make deals with wings of the Republican Party that are socially conservative. 

IMO, it's more that the Conservative wing are morally bankrupt on social issues. They don't have a strong stance and are willing to go with whatever best advances their economic issues. 

And that moral bankruptcy seems to extend to Trump. They are willing to work with him. They wouldn't adopt a policy of concentration camps themselves, but they might go along with it *(please prove me wrong)*

# Neoconservatives

This faction basically controlled the government during the Bush-Cheney administration, and the reason Bush invaded Iraq and Afghanistan. 

Neoconsertives are essentially just Conservatives who also think America should be way more active in international politics... with their military. They strongly believe in ""Peace though strength""

A number of Trump's advisers on international policy and military are Neoconsertives.  
 They are the ones pushing for this ""100 day ceasefire deal"" in Ukraine. Not because they are pro-Russia or anti-Ukraine. But because they think Russia is militarally irrelevant and the conflict is sucking up resources that should instead be focused on China.

They are morally bankrupt too. Literally the people who created gitmo in the first place. But they are very pro-NATO and I suspect they are horrified at Trumps efforts towards Greenland/Canada/Mexico. 

# Moderates

These are basically the type of republican that you see elected in blue states or swing states. John McCain is one of the more well-known members of this faction.

They have similar views on economic issues as the Conservative wing, but actually care about social issues, aka fiscally conservative but socially liberal. They generally support LBGT+ rights, gun control and even abortion. Maybe not as proactively as progressives, but more than anyone else in Republican Party. 

Most of this faction are very anti-trump, usually ""Never Trumpers"". Some have even defected to the Democratic Party in recent years, and they are at the most risk of being primaryed. I'm not sure how much longer this faction will survive. 

# Libertarians

Not to be confused with the Libertarian party, this faction within the Republican Party is way more economically right than Conservatives. They don't just want a smaller government, they more or less want to eliminate the government altogether, let the free market run everything, everyone can defend their own homestead with their gun. 

A number of ""billionaire tech bros"" support this faction. And they love Trump, because they think he will tear the government down (deliberately or though incompetence, they don't really care)

# Christian Right

Perhaps better described as Christian Nationalists. At the extreme end, they want to declare America to be a Christian nation, rip down the separation between Church and State, and enforce Christian values onto everything. 

If the Conservatives are morally bankrupt, this faction is politically bankrupt. They don't care who they partner with, as long as they get lip service towards their moral policies. They have a long history of partnering with the Conservatives faction, essentially a match made in heaven. But have recently been cozying up to MAGA, which might be an even better match. 

I'm not sure how much the Christian Right faction exists anymore, they seem to have a very fluid boundary with the MAGA crowd.

# America First (MAGA)

*(Often called Trumpists, but I don't really think that's accurate; They will dump Trump if he fails at being a strong leader.)*

This faction is your literal fascists. They think America would be stronger if they got rid of democracy, seized power for themselves and forced everyone to conform. They have quite a bit in common with the Christian Nationalists, but they don't really care about the religion part. Though they will use it as a tool.",59,1738211210.0,0.9862,positive

> Neoconservatives ... the reason Bush invaded Iraq and Afghanistan

Iraq, yes. Afghanistan is a totally different situation. Only one member of congress voted against the Authorized Use of Military Force in 2001, Barbara Lee (D-CA). Notably Lee objected to the wording of the AUMF, and would have voted yea if certain changes were made.

I suspect you are young, and that's ok. As someone who lived through it, we were *attacked*. It was Pearl Harbor all over again. That morning on 9/11 every American knew we were at war with the perpetrators, and it would be a 100% justified military action. The AUMF was absolutely bipartisan. The democrats only became the anti-war party with the unjustified invasion of Iraq in 2003.

The indefinitely maintained and purpose-lacking occupation is another matter, but that is literally a generation later.

> Neoconservatives ... are the ones pushing for this ""100 day ceasefire deal"" in Ukraine ... because they think Russia is militarily irrelevant and the conflict is sucking up resources that should instead be focused on China.

I think you are confusing neoconservatives with China hawks, which are a separate group or at least a separate circle in this Venn diagram. There's a lot of overlap for sure, but China hawkishness isn't a core tenant of neoconservatism. Neoconservative foreign policy is more about nation building and make-the-world-America.

> Libertarians... a number of ""billionaire tech bros"" support this faction. And they love Trump, because they think he will tear the government down (deliberately or though incompetence, they don't really care)

That was true the last time. Now they are running the Trump administration thinking ""we can do better.""

> Christian Right ... At the extreme end, they want to declare America to be a Christian nation, rip down the separation between Church and State, and enforce Christian values onto everything.

This is ambiguously worded. No doubt some people like you describe do exist, but they are a small minority of just the christian right faction, not to mention the party as a whole. This is mostly a Margaret Atwood and Octavia Butler derived fantasy depiction of the christian right.",6,1738223403.0,0.9584,positive

refugee,"‚ÄúCanada will welcome you,‚Äù Trudeau invites refugees as Trump bans them","When my father was 15 years old, he, his brother and sister, and his mother finally came to Canada. As a German child, his first 5 years of life were in a war zone. They could see trains taking undesirables to the concentration camp in their area from their farm, always returning empty. Many members of his family were true believers. Others were resistance fighters.  His next decade was spent as a refugee in the rubble of his homeland. When they arrived in Canada, they discovered that their one piece of luggage with all their clothing, valuables, and warm jackets were stolen by someone who pretended to help his widowed mother with the luggage but actually made off with it. 

They took the train from Quebec to Winnipeg and found their lodging for the night. It was a small apartment, above the store and home of a nice Jewish couple. They hosted them that evening, made them soup, and when they heard their clothing had been stolen, immediately found them winter jackets from ones their own family members or neighbors had outgrown. 

My father told me that as he fell asleep that night, he thought about how this was a country where, not 10 years after watching the trains and smelling the ashes on the wind, a Jewish couple fed and clothed the son of a German soldier. He promised himself that this country is where he would stay and raise his family; this country where the past didn't matter as much as what kind of future we could build together. 

My father got the life he dreamed of. His children have never known war. He has a little log house, surrounded by trees, and he likes to just watch the snow fall. 

I'm so proud that Mr. Trudeau is preserving this Canada. The one where previous enemies are neighbors, and put their differences aside in favour of building something newer and better together. 

This is MY Canada. Refugees aren't nameless horrors; they are my parents. Chances are, your parents or grandparents came here, to build something new together as well.

Of course their situation is dire, but if we want to help shouldn't we start by helping to fix their own country or make any attempt at all to re-stabilize the region?

You're falling into a pit of oversimplifying the problem. Of course we want to stabilize the region, but when the region is in the middle of a full blown war with no reconciliation in sight, the only real way you can stabilize that situation is to commit, more troops, more weapons, more resources, etc. Basically, the only way to stabilize the region is to bring more war to it first, which means more civilian casualties, more destroyed cities, and in the end more displaced refugees. You don't just snap your fingers and solve the problem.

Now, the issue then becomes what to do with all these refugees while this bloody conflict is happening around them? Well, usually no country WANTS to have a bunch of displaced people suddenly show up at their door requiring food, shelter, etc. and has little to offer as compensation. So every country could just refuse to take them in, but then you have an entire country's population of innocent civilians trapped in the middle of a war, which doesn't bode well for the ability of the country to recover from the war and return to stability (not to mention is morally horrifying). So the international community signed a bunch of agreements that included  agreements to share the burden of sheltering innocent refugees so that no one country has to suffer under the weight of all those people. If, like you said, your hope would be that we'd work on helping stabilize a region, one thing that could absolutely help is to share more of the burden of sheltering refugees in the meantime, as having countries like Jordan and Turkey house millions of refugees each is obviously very destabilizing.

That and perhaps as much as you think people only do good things as ""virtue signaling"", some people actually do care about helping innocent people.",11,1485653421.0,-0.9428,negative

**The Facebook Near-Billionaire Secretly Funding Trump‚Äôs Meme Machine**

>The 24-year-old told The Daily Beast that he had used the pseudonym ‚ÄúNimbleRichMan‚Äù on Reddit with a password given to him by the organization‚Äôs founders.
>Nimble America says it‚Äôs dedicated to proving that ‚Äúshitposting is powerful and meme magic is real,‚Äù according to the company‚Äôs introductory statement, and has taken credit for a billboard its founders say was posted outside of Pittsburgh with a cartoonishly large image of Clinton‚Äôs face alongside the words ‚ÄúToo Big to Jail.‚Äù

>‚ÄúWe conquered Reddit and drive narrative on social media, conquered the [mainstream media], now it‚Äôs time to get our most delicious memes in front of Americans whether they like it or not,‚Äù a representative for the group wrote in an introductory post on Reddit.

>Along with Luckey, Nimble America was founded by two moderators of Reddit‚Äôs r/The_Donald, which helped popularize Trump-themed white supremacist and anti-Semitic memes along with 4Chan and 8Chan. A questionnaire to become a moderator at r/The_Donald posted in March had applicants answer the questions ‚ÄúIs there a difference between white nationalism and white supremacy?‚Äù and ‚ÄúWas 9/11 an inside job?‚Äù

>Potential donors from Donald Trump‚Äôs biggest online community‚ÄîReddit‚Äôs r/The_Donald, where one of the rules is ‚Äúno dissenters‚Äù‚Äîturned on the organization this weekend, refusing to believe ‚ÄúNimbleRichMan‚Äù was the anonymous ‚Äúnear-billionaire‚Äù he claimed to be and causing a rift on one of the alt-right‚Äôs most powerful organizational tools.

>Luckey insists he‚Äôs just the group‚Äôs money man‚Äîa wealthy booster who thought the meddlesome idea was funny. But he is also listed as the vice president of the group on its website.

>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs something that no campaign is going to run,‚Äù Luckey said of the proposed billboards for the project.

>‚ÄúI‚Äôve got plenty of money,‚Äù Luckey added. ‚ÄúMoney is not my issue. I thought it sounded like a real jolly good time.‚Äù

>But in another post written under Luckey‚Äôs Reddit pseudonym, there are echoes of a similar tech billionaire, Peter Thiel, who used his deep pockets to secretly fund a campaign against Gawker.

>‚ÄúThe American Revolution was funded by wealthy individuals,‚Äù NimbleRichMan wrote on Saturday. Luckey confirmed to The Daily Beast he penned the posts under his Reddit pseudonym. ‚ÄúThe same has been true of many movements for freedom in history. You can‚Äôt fight the American elite without serious firepower. They will outspend you and destroy you by any and all means.‚Äù

>Before becoming directly involved in the process, Luckey met the man who would serve as the liaison for the nascent political action group, and provide legitimacy to a Reddit audience for later donations without having to reveal Luckey‚Äôs identity: Breitbart tech editor and Trump booster Milo Yiannopoulos. The bleached-blonde political agitator is most notable for being permanently suspended from Twitter for harassment after a series of abusive messages to actress Leslie Jones.

>Luckey first met the alt-right provocateur in Los Angeles about a year and a half ago, before Yiannopoulos began working on a charity to send white men to college. The Daily Beast later reported that the scholarship fund had resulted in zero financial distribution of the donations that had been made directly to Yiannopoulos‚Äôs bank account.

>‚ÄúI came into touch with them over Facebook,‚Äù Luckey said of the band of trolls behind the operation. ‚ÄúIt went along the lines of ‚Äòhey, I have a bunch of money. I would love to see more of this stuff.‚Äô They wanted to build buzz and do fundraising.‚Äù",565,1485652824.0,0.9656,positive

It's a policy debate.

It's used, as it was here, as an argument against helping refugees.

Syria isn't the only region in the world that Western nations are accepting refugees from, you've just forgotten the others. Refugee intakes are like a lottery that people register for, so the effort is spread out. And those who can't be taken or leave war-torn countries still receive aid and protection as much as NGOs and UN organisations can manage.

In my opinion during the time of Pierre Elliot Trudeau's was some of the best, the golden era for immigration reform in the 70's (but there are dark times before and after it wasn't so easy). My point is ""lots of water"" isn't an excuse because we have come a far way.

""1999: The Fujian Boat People

In the summer of 1999, four boats carrying 599 migrants from the Fujian province in China arrived on the B.C. coast. Fleeing impoverished conditions and without proper identification, many declared refugee status...

Former RCMP officer Ken Ackles¬†described¬†the deplorable conditions aboard one of the boats: ‚ÄúIt was vomit-soaked, urine-soaked, feces-soaked blankets and clothing and everything that was down there in that hole ‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve smelt sewer plants that are cleaner than that.‚Äù

Overall, 444 of the 577 refugee claims were rejected.""

I'm not sure if it's a given, but I think that in Sudan, as well as a lot of middle eastern countries, there is animosity towards Israel, likely stemming from religious differences(Sudan, as well as other middle eastern countries, is a predominantly Muslim country, even if less so than Saudi Arabia or the others). 

So, I hope this news gets out, so that muslims and arabs, and people that bear animosity towards Israel for any reason, be it cultural or religious, can see that Israelis are also *human*. They feel sympathy, they can be kind, they're just people, they're not a one dimensional villain here to pillage your lands and kill your religion. ",305,1516666144.0,0.7274,positive

Constant war, a brutal and secretive dictatorship, poverty, disease, and a complete lack of human rights.

Many countries have conscription. Eritrea has indefinite, permanent, conscription. Roving gangs will enter a village and take away any male they find. The male is then in the Army until he escapes or dies.

Eritreans cannot travel inside the country, so if there is drought or famine in your area you cannot travel to another part of Eritrea to find work or food. 

If you leave the country without permission you are either jailed without trial, tortured until a bribe is paid, or conscripted for life upon return.

The country operates on a system of bribes. If you cannot pay a bribe you are arbitrarily detained without charge or trial until your family can scrape together enough cash, which is hard because in order to control the population the government limits the amount of money you can have at any one time.

Foreign media is banned, and as part of their ""national service"" hundreds of thousands of Eritreans are forced to work as slave labor in mines, extracting minerals and rare earth metals for suppliers who then turn around and sell those materials to foreign companies that turn them into cellphones and video game consoles.

Women are forced into national service as well, when sent to military camps for their service they are used as sexual slaves.

**Anyone who claims that an Eritrean refugee is an ""economic migrant"" is completely ignorant of the situation in that country.**

Sudan isn't much better.

The UN has never declared that everyone from ANY country is not entitled to refugee status.  That is a determination that can only be made on an individual basis, because it is based on the presence or absence of legitimate threats to the lives, health or safety of the potential refugee.

For example, there is no widespread civil unrest or public violence in the United States that would allow every American to flee the country and claim refugee status.  However, 12 U.S. citizens were granted asylum in Britain in 2015.

Bibi's Likud and the Zionist Union parties both have different ideas of Zionism for example. Or look at all the different kinds of Lefts in the West.

The core idea remains the same that Zionism believes in a home for the Jewish people, where they will no longer be persecuted, and to further the ""jewish cause"" by extending compassion to others fighting oppression. (Keep in mind most Jews believe in being Jewish as a culture, not as a religion. So the 'Jewish cause' has more in common with saying American values of liberalism.)

Well the Israeli Government isn't, they want to deport them. Largely this is just another aspect that can be expected of Netanyahu's Likud government which has to make routine concessions like this to the Far right in order to keep his coalition and power.

The Israeli people on the other hand I would say are much more in favor of keeping the refugees in Israel. Israelis are well known for travelling around the world to help work in refugee camps, peace corps, NGOs and rebuilding efforts, etc. However, there government is largely held hostage by an aging and disconnected far right populace.

Can you quote and/or link to the international law that says this? Amnesty tells me (in the context of the EU mind you which, granted, Israel; Ethiopia; Djibouti and Sudan are not in)...

>>There is no legal requirement for a refugee to claim asylum in any particular country

>>Neither the 1951 Refugee Convention nor EU law requires a refugee to claim asylum in one country rather than another.

>>There is no rule requiring refugees to claim in the first safe country in which they arrive.

>>The EU does run a system ‚Äì called the Dublin Regulations ‚Äì which allows one EU country to require another to accept responsibility for an asylum claim where certain conditions apply.

>>The relevant conditions include that the person is shown to have previously entered that other EU country or made a claim there. This is supposed to share responsibility for asylum claims more equitably among EU countries and discourage people moving on from one EU country to another. But it doesn‚Äôt work.

>>It is clear the system greatly benefits countries like the UK and is very unfair to countries like Greece and Italy. That‚Äôs part of the reason Germany has just suspended the Dublin Regulations when dealing with people fleeing from Syria.

edit: Yea, it's just not true. 

>>There is no obligation under the refugee convention or any other instrument of international law that requires refugees to seek asylum in any particular country. There has, however, been a longstanding ""first country of asylum"" principle in international law by which countries are expected to take refugees fleeing from persecution in a neighbouring state. This principle has developed so that, in practice, an asylum seeker who had the opportunity to claim asylum in another country is liable to be returned there in order for his or her claim to be determined.  https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/libertycentral/2010/sep/21/claim-asylum-uk-legal-position and http://www.unhcr.org/uk/excom/scip/3ae68ccec/background-note-safe-country-concept-refugee-status.html 

So a refugee is still a refugee even if they have travelled through safe and stable countries. However, over time countries have come to state by state agreements with each other that they can, if they want, pass a refugee back to the safe and stable countries they passed through and, if those countries agree to take them, that has been regarded as legally reasonable and as not contradicting international law. 

It's like that agreement you have with your neighbour that you're both going to paint each side of the fence between you. Legally you can tell him to fuck off because it's his fence not yours but in practice it's worked out well for both of you if you both do it, and it doesn't contradict any laws, so you both carry on doing it.",13,1516656368.0,0.9914,positive

The people smuggling business is a criminal enterprise, the people who are smuggled are often vulnerable, manipulated and threatened, and by receiving the boats the Australian government participates in their exploitation.

> Oh and it's also about safety.

It is that as well. These old, broken-down boats inevitably capsize in the middle of nowhere and everyone on board dies - and *then* Australia is blamed for not reacting fast enough. So Australia has to receive, from criminals, these people who don't have identification *and* has to ensure they are received safely?

Yeah, or you tell the world ""there's no fucking way you can get in here like that"". The prisons were a poorly handled mess but that doesn't stop all of this from being a completely untenable position for Australia to put itself in.",2,1516698134.0,-0.3222,negative

It specifically stated that on Jan. 1, 1863 all slaves in areas still under rebellion would be declared free and could be conscripted into military/government service. Lincoln said in September that he was going to do this to give rebels a chance to surrender. Slaves held in territory not in rebellion (like Maryland) were not freed by the EP. Of course slaves in confederate territory weren't *de facto* freed until the territory was liberated, although many chose to free themselves, as the fugitive slave act could not apply to a runaway slave from a territory that was in revolt.  Slavery was officially abolished by the 13th Amendment, passed after Lincoln's death. 
 
The point is that Lincoln's election moved states to secede because he would 'take their slaves.' Then he gave them a chance to surrender and keep their slaves. Then he freed slaves held by all those still in rebellion. But a slave in Delaware in December 1862 was still a slave in 1863, and would remain so until 1865 unless they got a lucky break. Odds are Lincoln would have just let slavery die out by cracking down on the illegal transatlantic slave trade, repealing the Fugitive Slave Act and barring slavery in any new territories.

The U.S, while currently accepting asylum seekers from Central America when they reach our border, has given Mexico millions of dollars to fortify their southern border, giving Mexico the task of deporting legitimate refugees back to their war torn countries. Europe also did everything in it's power to block Syrian refugees from entering the EU during the Syrian crisis. Spain has given Morocco tons of  money for them to keep African migrants from crossing the border into Spanish enclaves on the Mediterranean. Heck, even Arab states like Saudi Arabia and Yemen worked hard keeping Syrians from flowing south to their countries.

Hitler, in regards to the conference:

We, on our part, are ready to put all these criminals at the disposal of these countries, for all I care, even on luxury ships.

refugee,Justin Trudeau to apologize Nov. 7 for 1939 decision to turn away Jewish refugees fleeing Nazis,"This is a good act with lots of historic precedent in many countries. 

A formal apology from countries signifies recognition that the people alive today recognize that the actions of the previous governments were morally wrong and condemnable.


It's the same principle as posthumous pardons. Alan Turing was pardoned not because it would help get out of jail but because of the recognition of the wrong that British government committed.

The British government apologized for it too.

Lets see the objections raised in this thread 

>People weren't alive during that time 

True but the purpose of the apology is to recognize the act as wrong for current and future generations.

>This accomplished nothing.

Governments all over the world do lots of symbolic and diplomatic things. They are needed. 

Like condemning actions they think are wrong.

Handshakes for example accomplish nothing and are just symbolic. Why waste time shaking hands? You are just virtue signalling. 


>Why is he not out there making laws instead of apologies? 

Lawmaking in parliamentary system is a complex process with many people working of the laws. Not just members of parliaments but their aides as well. A prime minister does not spend every hour writing legislation directly.",1225,1536285728.0,0.9433,positive
refugee,Justin Trudeau to apologize Nov. 7 for 1939 decision to turn away Jewish refugees fleeing Nazis,"Philosophy question maybe: Can we acknowledge it was a bad thing without formally  apologizing for it because ""we"" current Canadians didn't do it? 

Very few Canadians that had anything at all to do with that decision and process are still alive today. That raises the question as to whether a nation owes an apology when most citizens that supported that action are now dead? Would it not be better to create laws that prevent the current generation from repeating it, rather than apologize for the actions of the previous generation?

The reason I'm asking is some of my friends that don't like Trudeau much suggest he's just too apologetic and that trend of him riding the ""Canadians say sorry a lot"" train is getting old and starting to make him look weak. I'm thinking this might provide some more fuel for this argument, and I'm wondering if it would be better to handle it a bit differently.

[EDIT: I've mentioned in several other heavily downvoted comments that this concern comes from ""friends"" (Facebook acquaintances, actually), and those comments collectively were downvoted hard because people interpreted it as me just hiding my own opinion behind it. It probably doesn't matter, but this being said by friends and not myself is actually true and I don't personally share that opinion. I was seeing if their concern was legitimate, and seeking ammo to counter it if it wasn't... and it's clearly not judging from the majority of the many replies. Comments like ""Lol why don't you just say you hate Trudeau?"" are kinda disappointing, other comments that provide really good counterarguments, and there are quite a few of them, are not.

The Harper government signed off on the deal, and the government of Canada will get tax revenue off the $15bn. Canada isn't getting $15bn out of it. For some reason this wasn't at all controversial when Harper approved the deal, but was front-page news when Trudeau didn't cancel it.

Trudeau could not cancel the sale for two reasons: 1) nixing a legitimate business deal made in good faith by a previous government sets a bad precedent and can discourage foreign entities from doing business with Canadian companies in the future 2)¬†nixing the deal would have resulted in a multi-billion dollar penalty that the government would have had to pay¬†according to the terms Harper agreed to.

My *personal* reaction isn't *negative*, but is a big ""eh"". I judge Canada and other countries based on their actions in the current era. 

Is an apology for a historical wrong good? I guess it's not *bad*, but it's mostly meaningless at this point. He's not the person who turned them away, nor is any of his government. In fact, just about everyone involved is dead.

If Canada's actions in the present-day were problematic, it wouldn't move the needle at all for improving my opinion of it.

And a lot of these sorts of ""long overdue"" apologies that are *this* far overdue feel more like political grandstanding on the back of a historic tragedy than meaningful.

refugee,Justin Trudeau to apologize Nov. 7 for 1939 decision to turn away Jewish refugees fleeing Nazis,"Unfortunately, it's often mentioned as a forgettable aside in high school or entry level college courses, if that. Even the most famed victims seldom get more than brief summaries.

Jewish refugees were an international problem no country wanted to deal with. By the time the war began in Europe, the US alone had a waiting list of 300,000 Jews. It was a slow, arduous, and expensive process. By 1941, multiple additional stipulations were placed on those of German and Italian descent. One man named Otto had already fled with his family from Frankfurt to the Netherlands when it too was invaded. After, he believed that reaching America would be the only guarantee of safety for his wife and two daughters. This proved to be near impossible when, coupled with other heavy restrictions, they would also have to all receive visas simultaneously. Otto considered entry through a third party state, and received a visa for only himself to Cuba, but this was rescinded within days when Germany declared war on the US. When in 1942 Otto's daughter Margot was ordered to a work camp, the family went into hiding. For two years, they hid with other Jewish families. His daughters continued their education; Margot was adept at math, while her younger sister Anne grew fond of reading and writing.

How the Nazis got wind of them is still unknown, but the building was raided and everyone arrested in September of 1944, mere weeks after the liberation of Paris. Otto's family was sent to Auschwitz, where men and women were separated upon arrival. His wife soon died of starvation. Margot and Anne were transported to another labor camp, where accounts describe them as emaciated, bald, and with tremors. Sometime between February and March of 1945, they too both died from an outbreak of typhus. They were 19 and 15 years old, and were buried in a mass grave. The camp was liberated on April 15.

Otto had survived, and soon discovered the fate of his family. He was eventually convinced to compile the notes of his youngest daughter, left strewn across the floor of their raided hiding place. The most famous and enduring passages from those notes read, ""It's difficult in times like these: ideals, dreams and cherished hopes rise within us, only to be crushed by grim reality. It's a wonder I haven't abandoned all my ideals, they seem so absurd and impractical. Yet I cling to them because I still believe, in spite of everything, that people are truly good at heart.""",3,1536311299.0,-0.8631,negative

refugee,Justin Trudeau to apologize Nov. 7 for 1939 decision to turn away Jewish refugees fleeing Nazis,"Maybe it's just me, but I think it's stupid to want apologies from people who weren't even alive at the time.  I don't go to prison for my dead grandpa who killed someone 70 years ago and I don't apologize for him because I don't feel I have to be responsible for people when I was not even alive when I was born. 

Why should it be any different with the state authorities? Why should the apology mean anything to anyone? It's sad that they didn't apologize for their actions back then, but at some point the time is up and both parties have to move on. 

Did you ever have to apologize for something you didn't do in the past? I have a pretty bad childhood memory of it and you should feel bad about it. An apology means something. So I'm against empty apolegies for political correctness because it devalues apologies in the future.

refugee,Justin Trudeau to apologize Nov. 7 for 1939 decision to turn away Jewish refugees fleeing Nazis,"It would be hard to call the Blackshirts a ""strong"" force in the UK. They had a fair amount of support at first but they lost support as they became increasingly radical. They never had any political power, and never won an election even with their early support. Not that they weren't vocal and visible.

From wikipedia:

>The BUF's foundation was initially met with popular support and developed a sizeable following. The press baron [Lord Rothermere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Harmsworth,_1st_Viscount_Rothermere) was a notable early supporter. As the party became increasingly radical, however, support declined. The Olympia Rally of 1934, in which a number of anti-Fascist protestors were attacked, isolated the party from much of its following. The party's embrace of [Nazi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi)\-style [anti-semitism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-semitism) in 1936 led to increasingly violent clashes with opponents, notably the 1936 [Battle of Cable Street](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Cable_Street) in [London](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London)'s [East End](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_End). The [Public Order Act 1936](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Order_Act_1936), which banned political uniforms and responded to increasing political violence, had a particularly strong effect on the BUF whose supporters were known as ""Blackshirts"" after the uniforms they wore.  
>  
>Growing British hostility towards [Nazi Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany), with which the British press persistently associated the BUF, further contributed to the decline of the movement's membership. It was finally banned by the British government in 1940 after the start of the Second World War, amid suspicion that its remaining supporters might form a pro-Nazi ""[fifth column](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifth_column)"". A number of prominent BUF members were arrested and interned under [Defence Regulation 18B](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defence_Regulation_18B).

Despite strong resistance from anti-fascists, including the local [Jewish community](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Jews), the [Labour Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Labour_Party), the [Independent Labour Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_Labour_Party), and the [Communist Party of Great Britain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_of_Great_Britain), the BUF found a following in the [East End](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_End_of_London) of [London](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London), where in the [London County Council](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_County_Council) elections of March 1937, it obtained reasonably successful results in [Bethnal Green](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bethnal_Green), [Shoreditch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoreditch), and [Limehouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limehouse), polling almost 8,000 votes, although none of its candidates was elected.[\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Union_of_Fascists#cite_note-5) The BUF never stood in a [General Election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_elections).

True, the US military was segregated for the entirety of the war, but shortly thereafter it was integrated--long before schools, sports, or workplaces were integrated. And the horror of the Holocaust in the WASPish mind really can't be overstated: the white Christian majority was forced to face the logical conclusion of their bigotry, and they recoiled in disgust and in shame.

It's very interesting that you use us as an example of what others could do. I encourage you to go to Lebanon, if you haven't already, and ask some people around what they think of the refugee policy (we don't really have one to be fair, people just come here).

Nobody wants millions of people who can't do any qualified work and who are draining our already limited resources. There are a lot of tensions about what to do with them, and several are being sent back to Syria by the Army where it is deemed safe enough.

And keep in mind that we actually have historical ties to Syria, we aren't that different, we were the same country not so long ago. We speak basically the same language with a few dialectical differences. Even with that, there are still massive issues and challenges to having all these people around.

Additionally, most of the people we've taken in aren't vetted, they didn't go through an extensive immigration screening. The majority of them we can't send elsewhere because European leaders come regularly to speak with our politicians and beg them not to offload them into Europe.

I know that it seems like this will play into what I assume is your argument, that other nations should alleviate the burden from countries like Lebanon. But that is not the case. European immigration policies are completely out of whack and unrealistic. Compassion is one thing, but taking in hundreds of thousands of people every year, with little to no vetting due to the sheer amount of people placing a heavy toll on migration agencies is no solution. I personally know people who get to Europe, destroy their Lebanese passports and pass of as Syrians in order to get a free pass into any European country. And once you're in, you're in.

Yep, hindsight revision. 

Once people knew the full extent of what Nazi Germany was doing then sympathy for Jews rose massively, but this didn't really occur until the very end of the war. 

At the start the idea of a government relocating and persecuting a minority wasn't exactly a valid excuse to go to war. Britain was already persecuting Indians, the French, the Vietnamese and Belgium had the Congo. 

Pretty much the only reason France and the UK went to war was because Germany was a serious geopolitical threat, Poland was an ally and had been overrun. Germany had also already upset the balance of power in Europe by instigating a naval arms race with the UK as well as things like the Anchluss.

Think of it this way - London civilians where dying. French civilians we're dying. Russian civilians we're dying. African civilians we're dying. Polish civilians we're also massacred - including priests, women and children. The report across the board were fucking horrific, and and a damn good reason to defeat Hitler.


But then Eisenhower reached the camps, and his jaws dropped. Here, humans weren't even dying in combat. They were worked to death and slaughterered with the cold effeciency of a meatpacking factory killing cattle. 


The rumors and reports turned out to be true - the Germans were literally shipping elderly, men, women and children in trains built for transporting cattle. They were starved, then gassed, then burned. The ash of burned human flesh covered the camp rooftops. Nazi gaurds, at gunpoint, we're forcing the starved Jews to carry thier own dead to the furnaces. The Nazis were still using their running trains to bring Jews to the camps instead of using them to bring troops to defend Germany from invading Russians. Hitler was more dedicated to killing Jews than consolidating defensive forces.


And then, and once the extent of the Holocaust against the Jews (and the gays and disabled as well) was known. Eisenhower ordered that troops walk through the camps and record everything they saw, so no one cold deny it happened.

But until the alleys actually reached the camps and saw what was going on, they didn't believe or focus on the reports of genocide.

Once people are in this safe zone, you can properly vet those who are able to obtain documentation to leave at a controlled pace.

Many of the Muslims moving to Europe don't want to integrate, they want their new neighbors to convert instead. They don't want dogs, even assistance dogs, on public transportation. They want to limit what girls wear in schools, and stop them from playing sports. They treat women as second-class citizens and expect to be allowed to continue. They even want, and enforce, their own separate justice system. I'll give a few specific examples for just the UK:

After Charlie Hebdo printed their infamous cartoon, 10,000 Muslims in London held a [massive protest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ay0PQuIXZ4) on the streets. They submitted a petition with 100,000 signatures demanding that Britain honor Islamic tradition, and said that production of cartoons of Mohammed are ‚Äúan affront to the norms of civilised society.""

[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8WVkbXOHfM)shows another recent protest, this time in a smaller city 30 miles from London. Marchers chanted ""British police burn in hell"" and held signs like, ""Shariah: the solution."" The reporter in this video is told she looks ""naked"" for wearing a baggy red dress, and is asked, ""who are you trying to seduce?""

In Muslim neighborhoods, private Shariah courts enforce Islamic codes, and ignore British laws. The problem has gotten so bad and so widespread that the Home Secretary [declared in spring 2015](http://www.bowgroup.org/policy/bow-group-report-parallel-world-confronting-abuse-muslim-women-britain) that it would try to crack down on these usurping authorities, but since many Muslims will refuse to obey British law or use the real courts, it's unlikely to be very effective.

At the end of the day, while the EU does have a human obligation to these refugees, they have an even more important obligation *to their own citizens*. Some countries in the EU can accept tens of thousands of refugees (i.e. France, Germany), but not all EU countries have the financial stability or infrastructure to deal with such an enormous influx of refugees.

People also forget that not every country is Germany, or France, that has the economic infrastructure and wealth to support literally 10s of thousands of people who are basically just freeloading for the foreseeable future.

Numbers have proven that since allowing refugees, there have been more rapes than ever before in Sweden. Sweden is now the rape capital of the west.

( included in the video linked ) Refugees have been recorded shouting that under Sharia law, these women are seen as infidels and Allah would be pleased if they were raped followed by more cheering. 

You are not permitted to carry a weapon for personal defense in Sweden. That means these women are not allowed to defend themselves the way they should be able to. There have been several reports of children getting raped. There was a story recently about a 12-year-old Swedish girl walking by a refugee center on her way home from a restaurant in the early afternoon and was raped. After stumbling along crying for help, she was raped again by another refugee. There have been multiple stories of women getting gang raped, spit on and called a whore as refugees watch in a circle. One of these women were raped so brutally she was confined to a wheelchair.

May have to add that I myself have been a Socialist my whole life, grew up with the ideology and to me it has always been the most humane one.

The thing today is that the Socialists doesn't give a fuck about the working class, or the lack of housing, or segregation. Everything is about immigration nowadays. Out of all the government parties, there's one that is criticizing the current politics, the rest of them are just yes-sayers, afraid to say anything else because they don't want to lose votes and get a bad public image.

There's a reason why the only immigration critic party today is one of the biggest party in Sweden (sadly). And even though they're that big, they get 0 influence and last December all parties voted for the same budget just to freeze out the immigration critic party.

Not only that, but there are tons of difference between our societies that will make things different. Like, Europe is much less economically liberal than the US, which has several consequences. One of them is that it's both easier to find a job and to lose it in the US, whereas in Europe there's better job security but it makes it harder to get in to begin with. Another difference is that our public assistance is MUCH more generous, which can encourage some kind of leeching.

Because it is impossible for their side to be bad. I saw a post about the Las Vegas shooter a couple years ago from the donald. Before the shooter's identity was revealed, they wrote it off as a Muslim extremist attack. When his identity was verified as a white male, they said it was a false flag. 

Same thing with the New Zealand shooter in 2019. They claim that he was actually a socialist radical, who just so happened to write a manifesto full of right wing talking heads. He was just ""trolling"" and trying to piss people off. Or something similiar to that. 

I don't want to sound callous, but at least Bin Laden admitted when it was his attack, and Bernie Sanders even came out against the baseball shooter.  These far right types seem to live in a different reality. They say all the things that these shooters believe, but deny that their views are violent. 

They hide it behind a thin layer of irony and use dogwhistles. So when you try to call them out on it, they can say they are just joking. 

They push and push and push, and when you finally have enough and push back, they cry victim. 

I have no problems with conservatives. I fundamentally disagree with their whole ideology, and I would never want to censor their views on taxation, abortion, tarrifs, immigration, etc.

They paid 40 informants who were close to/members of the right-wing terror group NSU (National Socialist Underground) which murdered 9 migrants and a police woman, attempted murder 43 times, committed 15 robberies and 3 attacks with explosives. So basically they were paying 40 out of 100-150 members of that group who then (allegedly?) used the money to buy weapons and support the group in other ways.

A few cliffnotes off the top of my head:

* The [National Socialist Underground](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Socialist_Underground) and how all of it was handled. Highlights include 100-200 presumed supporters (3 were found guilty, 2 are dead) as well as federal money being spent on financing the group directly and/or people supporting them. Files having gone missing or having been intentionally destroyed. A Federal Agent was present for at least one of the murders - no charges were brought up even though [independent research groups called out his testimony as false](https://forensic-architecture.org/investigation/the-murder-of-halit-yozgat). Some of *those* files are under seal for 120 years, something that never happened in Germany before to protect the investigators involved.

* We have [former special forces soldiers](https://www.focus.de/politik/deutschland/politik-die-verschwoerung_id_9879853.html) casually chatting about weapon depots, taking over Germany and shooting training in Poland or Czechia. From helicopters.

* We have [SWAT police officers](https://www.t-online.de/nachrichten/panorama/kriminalitaet/id_85913708/mecklenburg-vorpommern-polizisten-sollen-lka-munition-weitergegeben-haben.html) being arrested for passing on police ammunition to preppers.

* [A few days ago a policeman was sentenced for violating data privacy laws](https://www.reddit.com/r/de/comments/c24qwl/polizei_berlin_verh%C3%A4ngnisvolle_fehleinsch%C3%A4tzung/), after he threatened left-wing extremists with police information. The fun part? His partner was among the commission responsible for **pulling off** surveillance of Anis Amri, the Islamist who ran a truck into people in 2016 - to surveil left-wingers instead. The latter went nowhere, but leading politicians promised crackdowns on those during the election campaigns at the time.

* The head of our Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution was fired not too long ago, partially because he, among other things, focused on ""left-wing extremist elements"" within our main center-left party, spread literal fake news and lied to our Bundestag. He's a part of the right-most wing of the German CDU and now actively pursues politics.

In short, there seems to be *decades* of partially incompetence or outright subversion which are slowly being unraveled - hopefully.

Turns out that if you give neo-Nazis money to work for you they might not always suddenly *actually* help you out. Also turns out that it can become hard to root out extremist elements within your own workforce, especially when oversight is lacking at times.

RaF? Discussed to completion. 

Lets discuss ""Operation Gladio"", where the americans hired and trained european neo nazis, NOT ""far right forces"", NEO NAZIS to act as a stay behind army. Yep, nothing to see here, just fielding an army of neo nazis and training it. It was supposed to be over, but surprise, in the 2006's, it was revealed that german neo nazis had bunkers full of american dollars, and such...

Lets discuss the NSU where actual neo nazis, not ""I have to buy tiki torches at wallmart because I am too incompetent to get a twig burning"" wannabes, went on a multiple year killing spree, and killed turkish people living and working in germany. 

If money went from american state interests, including the american secret services or their shell companies, to german right wing , in a grand similie to what the *** ***** ***** of an american ambassador to germany, im plain violation of Article 41 of the Vienna Convention on diplomatic relationships, to quote Buzzfeed news, ""The German foreign ministry has asked the new US ambassador to Germany to clarify comments he made during an interview with Breitbart over the weekend in which he said he wanted to ‚Äúempower‚Äù right-wing antiestablishment parties in Europe"", then it isn't the german right wing that needs to be dissected. 

What needs to be said is that germany is like a recovering alcoholic. Everybody knows this, and tries their very best to not make things difficult for germany. Sure, in a moment of anger, they might yell out what germany did to them, but afterwards, they come over as just as bigof an, if not bigger of an, asshole as the germany they were cussing out. 

But even without that, it's a day by day work. We can't, and will never declare victory over national socialism, we take each day as it comes, and try our best to not be neo nazis. And fuck me, we made some good progress. 

If it's however true that the american secret services have been funding the german neo nazi underground, knowing full well what would happen, it must be compared to a guy bringing a bottle of booze to the house of a dry alcoholic, knowing full well it is a daily struggle for the dude, and making jello shots for the dry alcoholic going ""what? The dude needs to relax, and it's not as if a glass or two will kill him"". 

There should be not a single opportunity for cooperation with the USA, untill it is willing to extradite the people responsible, and have the ambassador make a public apology for the deeply disgusting behavior, if possible on TV and on all fours. 

Untill then? We stop using cutesy code words. 

Fuck the americans that try to whitewash things by calling them ""far right"".

Appearances to the contrary, this is the safest period in human history. You are less likely to die now due to violence than any other period in our past, despite the continuing ""war on terror"" and the terrorist attacks that proceeded the war. For reference, refer to the fantastic book, [""The Moral Arc: How Science Leads Humanity Toward Truth, Justice, and Freedom.""](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Moral_Arc)

That being said, we are only safe now because of violence in the past and the continued threat of using superior power in a fight, whether economically, militarily, diplomatically, whatever. I would argue that, barring extreme alternate circumstances, violence's place is a last resort to save more lives. It's easy to say that we could never make that choice when we aren't in that situation. It really doesn't matter whether you talk about individual people or governments, there are always extreme circumstances. Just watch an episode of Black Mirror.

That was the first time around, the BVerfG said ""State and party are too intertwined for us to figure out what actions are to be attributed to the state and which to the party"". In other words, they decided very early in the case that any ruling they did could not defend itself against the challenge of not having properly considered entrapment.

There was a second attempt at banning the NPD, this time the states did their homework. Evidence was collected and analysed, and the court came to the conclusion that the party, as a whole (and not just stray members) is out to combat the free and democratic basic order. However, to get outlawed, a party does not only have to have to have such goals, but it also has to be capable of actually endangering that order. On that count the court ruled that the NPD is just too impotent so they were allowed to keep on dabbling.

Both of those rulings are quite typical of the type of rulings our Constitutional Courts hands out: As a rule of thumb, they're fundamentalist when it comes to the rule of law, and also very very even-handed.

However, they *did* lose access to state funds (In Germany, parties get funding based on election results), which was a possibility the court explicitly hinted at in the reasoning to their decision: The state has to tolerate impotent opposition against the free and basic democratic order, however, it can't be bloody expected to aid such shenanigans.",4,1561027130.0,0.9109,positive

I got to see different Christian services, hindu, Jewish, Buddhist, etc. Everything was equality, peace, nonviolence, service. Thankfully those lessons stuck.

But after 9/11 my parents turned on fox news and they never turned it off again. It's been 2 decades. My dad turns it on in the morning and it's all he watches. He gets in his car and it's fox news satellite radio which I'm pretty sure is just the TV feed audio. My mom is busy posting anti Hillary Facebook memes. They've got their Maga hats. It's their whole life. Recently my mom was talking all this pro evangelical bullshit on Facebook. We've never been even remotely evangelical. She doesn't go to church and was never overly religious. It just wasn't what we did. But because that's what 'the base' is about its what she is about. It's total brainwashing without question.

They're not bad people, but I think they were just the prime target for all of it. Trumps lunacy. The Fox News power of suggestion.

One of the consequences of this was that the West Germans were much more open to those of foreign descent (and more progressive policies in general) relative to the East Germans post-reunification. Hence, parties like the AfD have found much better success in the eastern half of Germany compared to the western half.

But of course, this was a historical development that plays into contemporary issues, and I'm inclined to say that the education quality received nowadays in both halves are similar if not roughly congruent.

I think it becomes an identity, and a way to belong. I've even seen it create social outlets, which hey, older people need.

And the way the baby-boomers have taken to social media... Don't get me started. We talk about young people needing to be shielded from fake news and viral culture; that they need to be taught to think critically about what they read and the information they spread. Well, we have 70-year-olds with university degrees and accomplished careers who are falling into these traps and using social media (and I include messaging apps here) with less sophistication than a 12-year-old.

So whatever problematic relationship Korea and China have with Japan is more than warranted, in my opinion. What Japan gets away with nowadays in terms of provoking their neighbours and going back on apologies that were always very very half-hearted to begin with, is mind-boggling.

hoenstly, no, they didn't. Both, the west and the east prosecuted the worst offenders, but let the vast majority of Nazis alone and often in charge, simply because removing all the Nazis would mean removing everyone who is capable of running the country and the companies. The Nazis did a pretty good job in the 12 years in power to remove everyone that was against them from the positions of power so that the only one left with experience were Nazis or at least affiliated to them.

You can see that the attitude in the west didn't change that much, just that it went from open hostility to silence and supressing what happend, ignoring and going forward. It was only the '68er movement and pushes of a few prosecutors that risked life and career to hunt down former Nazi criminals beginning in the 60's. And for the real change in society, it was the dreadded question ""Dad - what did you during the war"" that fired up sometimes violent student protests and sociatal pushes from the youth to break the silence and to rework society.

In the east, it went even worse. These that were left from the Nazi regime and weren't purged became part of the eastern society, and basically transitioned into positions of power, now just acting out instead of calling it the nationalist movement, they did it under the pretense of the socialist glory. And as having the option of socialism, which was in the eyes of the socialist idiology, was enough to convince the vast population to stop wanting capitalism or fascism, they never started with these processes that the west had with their '68er movement, which can be seen today quite well as the biggest hotspots of fascist, nationalistic and xenophobe movements are mostly in east Germany.",8,1561019327.0,-0.9864,negative
